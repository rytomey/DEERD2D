Harvest data have the potential to be used as an abundance index due to its widespread availability and long‐term collection across large geographical areas. However, challenges such as the lack of hunting effort information, varying data resolutions and reporting biases hinder its direct use as an abundance proxy.

Here, we present the game target‐group, a statistical approach based on a thinned inhomogeneous Poisson point process, to estimate animal abundance at fine‐scale resolution from hunting data. We employ a Bayesian hierarchical framework to borrow information from harvest data on related species to overcome issues due to the lack of hunting management information. We conducted a simulation study to explore model performance and parameter identifiability under different scenarios (sample size, species catchability/abundance and unmodelled heterogeneity) and assessed the method on a real case study with four species in central Spain.

The simulation study confirmed that with a large enough sample size (n > 5000), high catchability and lack of unmodelled heterogeneity in the abundance process, the model was able to obtain unbiased estimations for total abundance parameters. In the case study, our model successfully captured species‐habitat relationships and produced reliable estimates of total abundance at regional scale. Internal validation with independent test data and external validation with fieldwork data confirmed the model's ability to predict hunting yields and estimate species total abundance accurately.

Our approach provides a flexible and valuable tool for large‐scale monitoring programs relying on harvest data with potential applications in wildlife management and conservation. However, the method should be applied with caution when there is unmodelled heterogeneity, low catchability or the sample size is small (<5000).

Here we present a density-dependent population dynamics model that can be used in conjunction with adaptive management to optimize big game management, designed to use data commonly collected by state and provincial wildlife agencies. We review a case study for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in North Dakota, USA, where we evaluate how harvest composition and monitoring frequency affect the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Data were obtained from winter aerial surveys and hunter questionnaires over six years between 2009 to 2019. Harvest composition moderately skewed towards antlered individuals (37.5% antlerless deer and 62.5% antlered deer, i.e., antlerless:antlered harvest ratio = 0.6) resulted in a harvest rate of 0.2, which translates to a long-term harvest that is more than double that obtained if the harvest composition matched the population composition. However, given environmental uncertainty, we recommend that managers adopt a harvest strategy that is at least 10-15% lower than the maximum sustainable yield to buffer against environmental variability. Despite the fact that contrasting monitoring schemes resulted in similar optimal harvest rates, we illustrated how adopting an adaptive harvest strategy (i.e., where harvests change with population size) affords lower risks of overexploitation than a static strategy in which populations are assessed only occasionally. An adaptive harvest strategy features resilience allowing harvested populations to return to equilibrium even after substantial perturbation events}}

In 2002, Pennsylvania adopted new APRs for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) that required, depending on wildlife management unit, ≥3 or ≥4 points on 1 antler for legal harvest. Historically, harvest rates of subadult (1.5yr old) and adult (≥2.5yr old) antlered males averaged 0.80. Antler point restrictions were designed to protect ≥50% of subadult males from harvest. Most adult males remained legal for harvest. We estimated harvest rates, survival rates, and cause-specific mortality of radio-collared male deer (453 subadults, 103 adults) in 2 wildlife management units (Armstrong and Centre counties) to evaluate biological efficacy of APRs to increase recruitment of adult males during 2002–2005. We administered statewide deer hunter surveys before and after each hunting season over the same 3 years to evaluate hunter attitudes toward APRs. We conducted 2 types of surveys: a simple random sample of all license buyers for each survey and a longitudinal panel of hunters who completed all 6 surveys. At the same time APRs were implemented, the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) increased antlerless harvests to reduce deer density to meet deer management goals.

Survival rates varied by month and age but not between study areas or among years after implementation of APRs. Monthly survival rates for subadults ranged from 0.64 to 0.97 during hunting seasons and 0.95 to 0.99 during the non-hunting period. Annual survival of subadults was 0.46 (95% CI=0.41–0.52). Adult monthly survival rates ranged from 0.36 to 0.95 during hunting seasons and we had no mortalities during the non-hunting period. Annual survival of adults was 0.28 (95% CI=0.22–0.35). Antler point restrictions successfully reduced harvest rate for subadults to 0.31 (95% CI=0.23–0.38), and approximately 92% of these deer survived to the following hunting season. Vehicle collisions were the greatest source of mortality outside the hunting season for subadults and adults. Also, we observed decreased harvest rates for adults (0.59, 95% CI=0.40–0.72), although nearly all were legal for harvest. Of radio-collared subadults, 6–11% were harvested with sub-legal antlers, indicating hunters generally complied with APRs. Overall, antlered harvest declined statewide and in our study areas, in part because of APRs but also because of increased antlerless harvests that reduced the statewide population from 1.49 million deer in 2000 to 1.14 million deer in 2005. However, between 2000 and 2005, harvest of adult males increased by 976 (112%) in Armstrong County, decreased by 29 (−3%) in Centre County, and increased by 14,285 (29%) statewide because more males survived to the 3- and 4-year-old age classes.

Proportion of hunters from the random sample surveys who supported statewide APRs varied among years between 0.61 (95% CI=0.59–0.64) and 0.70 (95% CI=0.66–0.73). The proportion of hunters from the longitudinal panel who supported APRs did not increase as hunters gained experience under the new regulations; 0.23 were more supportive, 0.29 were less supportive, and 0.48 were unchanged in their level of agreement after 3 years. Although >50% of hunters supported APRs throughout the study, support for the PGC's deer management program declined; 41% of the longitudinal panel of hunters rated the deer management program lower after 3 years and 21% rated it higher.

We considered APRs biologically successful because of decreased subadult harvest rates and increased harvest of adult males with larger antlers. Likewise, because the majority of hunters supported APRs throughout the study, we considered APRs socially successful. However, we predicted APRs would become increasingly popular after hunters experienced biological results of APRs, but there was little change in support. We believe hunters formed an initial impression of the effects of APRs, and additional experience and information failed to change their opinion. Furthermore, the concurrent reduction in overall deer densities to accommodate more males in the population and to meet agency deer population goals likely further reduced support for APRs. We found APRs as implemented in Pennsylvania to be enforceable, adhered to by hunters, and successful in recruiting more antlered males to older age classes. To facilitate social acceptance of these regulation changes, we found that obtaining support before the changes were implemented may have been important because most hunters did not change their opinions about APRs after 3 years of experience with the new regulations. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.}}

However, there are numerous modern-day issues that reduce the viability and efficacy of hunting-based management, such as fewer hunters, overabundant wildlife populations, limited access, and emerging infectious diseases in wildlife. Quantifying the drivers of recreational harvest by hunters could inform potential management actions to address these issues, but this is seldom comprehensively accomplished because data collection practices limit some analytical applications (e.g., differing spatial scales of harvest regulations and harvest data). Additionally, managing large-scale issues, such as infectious diseases, requires collaborations across management agencies, which is challenging or impossible if data are not standardized. Here we discuss modern issues with the prevailing wildlife management framework in the United States from an analytical point of view with a case study of white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) in the Midwest. We have four aims: (1) describe the interrelated processes that comprise hunting and suggest improvements to current data collections systems, (2) summarize data collection systems employed by state wildlife management agencies in the Midwestern United States and discuss potential for large-scale data standardization, (3) assess how aims 1 and 2 influence managing infectious diseases in hunted wildlife, and (4) suggest actionable steps to help guide data collection standards and management practices. To achieve these goals, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources disseminated a questionnaire to state wildlife agencies (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin), and we report and compare their harvest management structures, data collection practices, and responses to chronic wasting disease. We hope our “call to action” encourages re-evaluation, coordination, and improvement of harvest and management data collection practices with the goal of improving the analytical potential of these data. A deeper understanding of the strengths and deficiencies of our current management systems in relation to harvest and management data collection methods could benefit the future development of comprehensive and collaborative management and research initiatives (e.g., adaptive management) for wildlife and their diseases.}}

However, differences in deer survival between public and private lands can exist and, if unaccounted for, may affect wildlife agencies' ability to effectively manage statewide and local deer populations. From 2014 to 2016, we radiocollared and monitored survival of 79 adult white‐tailed deer (141 deer‐years; 62 male, 79 female) on 2 public and 2 private properties in Alabama, USA. We assessed the effects of sex, age, and landownership type (i.e., public or private) on adult white‐tailed deer harvest and survival patterns using an information‐theoretic approach. Hunter harvest accounted for 77% of observed mortalities ( n = 23/30), but harvest and survival rates varied by sex and age. Harvest and survival were similar between public and private property despite more restrictive hunting regulations for antlered deer on public areas. Similar harvest rates were likely due to self‐imposed, quality deer management (QDM) harvest strategies on private land that emulated the effects of a state‐mandated antler point restriction (APR) on public land. Our findings indicate survival rates of adult white‐tailed deer may be applicable across landownership types where state‐mandated harvest regulations with respect to males are more restrictive on public than private property, due to the popularity of QDM by private‐land deer hunters. However, where regulations are similar across landownership types (e.g., no state‐mandated APR), differences in harvest and survival rates may exist.}}

In the case of disease-caused mortality, the mortality attributed to one disease has the potential to buffer populations against subsequent alternative disease outbreaks by reducing populations and thus contacts needed to sustain disease transmission. However, substantial disease-driven population declines may also prevent populations from recovering, leading to localized extinctions. Hemorrhagic disease (HD), a vector-transmitted, viral disease in white-tailed deer (WTD), similar to chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion disease, has increased in frequency and distribution in the United States. However, unlike CWD, which progresses slowly, HD can cause mortality only days after infection. Hemorrhagic disease outbreaks can result in substantial localized mortality events in WTD near vector habitats such as wetlands and may reduce local deer densities and consequent CWD transmission. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential for HD outbreaks to buffer CWD risk where the diseases co-occur. Using an agent-based modeling approach, we found that frequent, intense HD outbreaks have the potential to mitigate CWD risk, especially if those outbreaks occur shortly after CWD introduction. However, HD outbreaks that do not result in substantial WTD mortality are unlikely to impact CWD or WTD population dynamics. Severe HD outbreaks may reduce CWD cases and could present an opportunity for managers to boost CWD control initiatives in a post-HD outbreak year.}}

By using a meta-analysis approach, we compared dispersal rates and distances from these populations together with published reports of 10 other nonmigratory populations of white-tailed deer. Population density did not influence dispersal rate or dispersal distance, nor did forest cover influence dispersal rate.

A triumvirate of increasing fawn predator populations reside in the Southern Appalachian Mountains including coyotes ( Canis latrans ), black bears ( Ursus americanus ) and bobcats ( Lynx rufus ). This region is also characterized by a homogenous landscape composed of mature forests and sparse understory vegetation, likely lacking adequate cover to offer fawns refugia from predators. Our objectives were to estimate survival and cause-specific mortality rates of fawns while assessing a possible link between mortality risk, intrinsic fawn characteristics (i.e., birth mass, Julian birth date, sibling status), and landscape features within fawn usage areas. During 2018–2020, we radio-collared 71 fawns within the Chattahoochee National Forest of northern Georgia, USA and monitored survival to 12 weeks of age. We observed low fawn survival (cumulative = 0.157, 95% CI = 0.091–0.273; vaginal implant transmitter = 0.196, 95% CI = 0.096–0.403) with predation as the leading cause of all known mortalities (45 of 55 mortalities; 82%) due primarily to coyotes ( n = 22), black bears ( n = 12), and bobcats ( n = 7). Relationships between landscape features and fawn predation risk were minimal with only one informative covariate. Increasing amounts of early successional land cover within fawn usage areas decreased fawn mortality risk within the first 20 days of life, but elevated mortality risk thereafter. All fawns with any amount of early successional land cover in their usage areas died of predation ( n = 13) at various time intervals, suggesting limited areas of potential fawning cover may be targeted by predators. However, fawn predation risk seemed to be high regardless of landscape covariates due to the limited number of surviving fawns. Coyote-caused mortality occurred over a longer period at a consistently higher magnitude than all other forms of mortality, indicating possible delayed prey-switching behavior and coyote predation as an important factor of fawn survival. The low recruitment of fawns influenced by high predation rates and homogenous habitat conditions is likely the cause of deer population declines in the region.}}

Conflicts range from destruction of vegetation through browsing to public perception that diseases carried by deer pose threats to human health. Traditional modes of hunting to control populations are inappropriate in many of these areas because of intense human development and activity. This article explores an alternative approach for population reduction based on deer social organization. Female white-tailed deer are highly philopatric and female offspring remain near their dams for life. This suggests that a population expands slowly as a series of overlapping home ranges in a form analogous to the petals on a rose. Incorporating the rose petal concept into a model of population growth shows that removal of deer by family unit can potentially alleviate conflicts in localized areas for as many as 10–15 yr.}}

Often, they rely on population models to monitor population trends. As imperfect representations of real-world populations, models must be rigor- ously evaluated to be applied appropriately. Previous research has evaluated population models for white- tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus); however, the precision and reliability of these models when tested against empirical measures of variability and bias largely is untested. We were able to statistically evaluate the Pennsylvania sex-age-kill (PASAK) population model using realistic error measured using data from 1,131 radiocollared white-tailed deer in Pennsylvania from 2002 to 2008. We used these data and harvest data (number killed, age-sex structure, etc.) to estimate precision of abundance estimates, identify the most efficient harvest data collection with respect to precision of parameter estimates, and evaluate PASAK model robustness to violation of assumptions. Median coefficient of variation (CV) estimates by Wildlife Management Unit, 13.2% in the most recent year, were slightly above benchmarks recommended for managing game species populations. Doubling reporting rates by hunters or doubling the number of deer checked by personnel in the field reduced median CVs to recommended levels. The PASAK model was robust to errors in estimates for adult male harvest rates but was sensitive to errors in subadult male harvest rates, especially in populations with lower harvest rates. In particular, an error in subadult (1.5-yr-old) male harvest rates resulted in the opposite error in subadult male, adult female, and juvenile population estimates. Also, evidence of a greater harvest probability for subadult female deer when compared with adult (� 2.5-yr- old) female deer resulted in a 9.5% underestimate of the population using the PASAK model. Because obtaining appropriate sample sizes, by management unit, to estimate harvest rate parameters each year may be too expensive, assumptions of constant annual harvest rates may be necessary. However, if changes in harvest regulations or hunter behavior influence subadult male harvest rates, the PASAK model could provide an unreliable index to population changes. 2012 The Wildlife Society.}}

In the Chattahoochee National Forest (CNF) in northern Georgia, deer harvest numbers and hunter success rates have drastically reduced over the last few decades, suggesting a decline in deer density. Low fawn survival (16%) was also recently recorded, prompting further concern regarding deer population sustainability. In the CNF, we radio-collared 14 yearling and 45 adult female white-tailed deer along with 71 fawns during 2018–2020 to estimate the annual survival and fecundity of each age class. We modeled future population growth (λ) over 10 years to evaluate the current rate of decline and various other management scenarios. Projections indicated that the white-tailed deer population will decline by an average of 4.0% annually under current conditions, and only scenarios that incorporated both antlerless harvest restrictions and improved fawn survival will lead to positive population growth. Thus, these approaches should be emphasized in future management plans within the Southern Appalachian region to facilitate recovery. This methodology can be applied by other wildlife managers with knowledge of site-specific vital rates to inform potential management strategies. Abstract Although generally abundant, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations in the southeastern United States have recently experienced several localized declines attributed to reduced fawn recruitment following the establishment of coyotes (Canis latrans). The Southern Appalachians is a mountainous region suggested to be experiencing white-tailed deer declines, as harvest numbers and hunter success rates have substantially decreased in northern Georgia since 1979. Low fawn survival (16%) was also recently documented in the Chattahoochee National Forest (CNF) in northern Georgia, necessitating further examination. We radio-collared 14 yearling and 45 adult female white-tailed deer along with 71 fawns during 2018–2020 in the CNF to estimate field-based vital rates (i.e., survival and fecundity) and parameterize stage-structured population models. We projected population growth rates (λ) over 10 years to evaluate the current rate of decline and various other management scenarios. Our results indicated that the observed population would decline by an average of 4.0% annually (λ = 0.960) under current conditions. Only scenarios including antlerless harvest restrictions in addition to improved fawn survival resulted in positive growth (λ = 1.019, 1.085), suggesting these measures are likely necessary for population recovery in the region. This approach can be applied by wildlife managers to inform site-specific management strategies.}}

The timing of female dispersal during fawning season and low dispersal rates suggest that competition for mates and reduced inbreeding are not ultimate causes of female dispersal, as suggested for males. We proposed that female dispersal is the result of competition for space when pregnant females seek to isolate themselves before and after parturition. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a meta-analysis of female dispersal rates from 12 populations of white-tailed deer and predicted dispersal rate and distance were positively related to deer density. We found a positive relationship between dispersal rate and deer per forested km 2 and between dispersal distance and deer per forested km 2 . These results are consistent with the hypothesis that female dispersal is density-dependent and caused by the exclusion of subordinate 1-year-olds as adult females seek isolation before and after parturition.}}

We conducted 24 road-based counts, covering 260 km of roadway, and deployed up to 16 camera traps, processing over 82,000 images representing over 5,000 independent observations.

In both years, we identified bucks based on their body and antler characteristics, tracking their movements between baited camera trap locations. We tested seven estimators commonly reported in the literature, comparing the relative merits for managers of small, protected natural areas like FRST.

Deer densities estimated from conventional road-based distance sampling were approximately 10 deer/km2 lower than densities estimated from camera-trapping surveys. We attribute the bias in road-based distance sampling to the difficulty of recording the precise effort expended to obtain the counts. Modifying the distance sampling method addressed many of the issues associated with the conventional approach. Despite little substantive differences in land cover types between the two methods, a clear spatial segregation of male and female deer at camera trap locations could bias road-based counts if the sexes are not encountered in proportion to their abundances. There was a distinct gradient in deer distribution across the study area, with higher proportions of deer recorded in camera traps at FRST than BCSP, which harvests 20?60 deer annually during a regulated, hunting season.

The most reliable (i.e., low bias, acceptable precision) methods, Spatial Capture Recapture (SCR) and Density Surface Modeling (DSM), produced deer densities of approximately 50 deer/km2 in each year ? a number which is consistent with previous estimates for New Castle County, Delaware, and our experience in similar, unhunted natural areas. Across both FRST and BCSP, these densities translated into area-wide (~1000 ha) population sizes between 650?1000 deer, with about one-half to two-thirds comprising the FRST population.

Density surface modeling of mapped locations of deer detected during surveys, combined with camera-trapping and a time-to-event data analysis might be the only practical means of reliably assessing white-tailed deer abundance in small (<2000 ha), protected natural areas like FRST. Most other approaches are either too time-consuming, require identification and tracking of individual deer, the use of bait, or require intervention by a subject-area expert.}}

Consequently, and importantly, much research has focused on understanding patterns of animal–vehicle collisions with the aim to reduce roadkill of wildlife. However, existing data on animal–vehicle collisions might also represent a novel opportunity to monitor wildlife populations. For this purpose, we compared data of >1.2 million hunter‐shot deer and >40,000 deer–vehicle collisions collected over 11 years in Denmark. We show that deer–vehicle collision data can be useful for population monitoring of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), fallow deer (Dama dama), and red deer (Cervus elaphus). Roe deer was the most numerous species, representing 90% of observations based both on deer–vehicle collisions and on hunting bag statistics. After accounting for factors related to road infrastructure (road length and density, traffic volume), local (municipality) deer–vehicle collisions were highly correlated with hunting bag data for roe and red deer (Pearson's r > 0.7) but not fallow deer, likely due to biases in hunting bags. Moreover, we used deer–vehicle collision data to map spatiotemporal changes in the distribution of fallow and red deer, and demographic changes in all species. Combined, our results suggest that animal–vehicle collision data can be a useful tool to supplement existing methods for monitoring wildlife populations, which will be relevant for the management of these populations. We point to important shortcomings in both animal–vehicle collision and hunting bag data and provide recommendations on how to improve their accuracy in the future, to be applicable for a broader range of species.}}

Wildlife diseases are gathering attention worldwide due to their public health and economic or conservation impacts, and consequently, wildlife agencies are increasingly being tasked with disease surveillance and management responsibilities. 2. Wildlife disease surveillance and management is challenging primarily due to complex processes of host population dynamics, some of which are inherently stochastic in nature. Individual heterogeneity in pathogen transmission further complicates our understanding of wildlife disease systems. 3. Agent‐based models can incorporate stochasticity as well as individual heterogeneities and facilitate a better understanding of epidemiological processes in wildlife disease systems. Such an understanding is critical for designing and implementing effective disease control strategies. 4. We have developed a customizable agent‐based modeling framework ( Ov CWD) that incorporates nonrandom and heterogeneous aspects of an emerging host–pathogen system (chronic wasting disease [CWD] in white‐tailed deer). Models in this framework link white‐tailed deer demography and behavior with CWD transmission dynamics. Insights gained from model explorations can help us better understand CWD spread in regional deer populations. 5. We illustrate Ov CWD application by deriving CWD outbreak probabilities for Montcalm County (Michigan, USA) deer population using alternate harvest strategies. The focus is on preemptive harvest strategies that can be implemented before CWD is detected in a population (pre‐establishment phase). 6. Ov CWD provides a defensible decision‐making context for designing locally relevant CWD control strategies. Ov CWD can be readily adapted for simulating CWD in other cervid species as well as for simulating other cervid disease systems.}}

A problem, however, is that although convenient and cost-effective, hunter-harvest samples are not representative of the population due to heterogeneities in disease distribution and biased sampling. We developed an agent-based modeling framework that i) simulates a deer population in a user-generated landscape, and ii) uses a snapshot of the in silico deer population to simulate disease prevalence and distribution, harvest effort and sampling as per user-specified parameters. This framework can incorporate real-world heterogeneities in disease distribution, hunter harvest and harvest-based sampling, and therefore can be useful in informing wildlife disease surveillance strategies, specifically to determine population-specific sample sizes necessary for prompt detection of disease. Application of this framework is illustrated using the example of chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance in Missouri’s white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population. We show how confidence in detecting CWD is grossly overestimated under the unrealistic, but standard, assumptions that sampling effort and disease are randomly and independently distributed. We then provide adjusted sample size recommendations based on more realistic assumptions. Wildlife agencies can use these open-access models to design their CWD surveillance. Furthermore, these models can be readily adapted to other regions and other wildlife disease systems.}}

These resulting changes in breeding behavior and population dynamics have potential to adversely affect population growth. In 2002, Pennsylvania implemented harvest regulation changes that reduced deer density (increased harvest of antlerless deer) and increased the number and age of antlered deer (implemented antler point restriction regulations) that resulted in a less female‐biased sex ratio. We monitored date of conception, productivity (embryos/female), and sex ratio of embryos during 1999–2006 to test if timing of breeding occurred earlier and with greater synchrony, if productivity of females increased, and if the sex ratio of offspring would shift towards more males. Deer density decreased 23% and the adult (≥1.5 yr old) sex ratio declined from 2.30 to 1.95 females/male. The ratio of ≥2.5‐year‐old to 1.5‐year‐old males shifted towards more older males (1:3.7 in 2002 to 1:1.59 in 2006) and the ≥2.5‐year‐old male population increased from 41,853 during 1999–2001 to 54,064 by 2006. We found no evidence of any change in the timing or variability of date of conception, productivity, or offspring sex ratio. We conclude that harvest regulation changes implemented in Pennsylvania, USA, were insufficient to affect timing of breeding or population dynamics and that efforts by managers to identify a desired sex ratio or manipulate sex ratios to achieve management goals on a statewide scale will be challenging. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.}}

Many field methods have been used to estimate deer abundance and density, but the factors determining where, when, and why a method was used, and its usefulness, have not been investigated. We systematically reviewed journal articles published during 2004–2018 to evaluate spatio‐temporal trends in study objectives, methodologies, and deer abundance and density estimates, and determine how they varied with biophysical and anthropogenic attributes. We also reviewed the precision and bias of deer abundance estimation methods. We found 3,870 deer abundance and density estimates. Most estimates (58%) were for white‐tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ), red deer ( Cervus elaphus ), and roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ). The 6 key methods used to estimate abundance and density were pedestrian sign (track or fecal) counts, pedestrian direct counts, vehicular direct counts, aerial direct counts, motion‐sensitive cameras, and harvest data. There were regional differences in the use of these methods, but a general pattern was a temporal shift from using harvest data, pedestrian direct counts, and aerial direct counts to using pedestrian sign counts and motion‐sensitive cameras. Only 32% of estimates were accompanied by a measure of precision. The most precise estimates were from vehicular spotlight counts and from capture–recapture analysis of images from motion‐sensitive cameras. For aerial direct counts, capture–recapture methods provided the most precise estimates. Bias was robustly assessed in only 16 studies. Most abundance estimates were negatively biased, but capture–recapture methods were the least biased. The usefulness of deer abundance and density estimates would be substantially improved by 1) reporting key methodological details, 2) robustly assessing bias, 3) reporting the precision of estimates, 4) using methods that increase and estimate detection probability, and 5) staying up to date on new methods. The automation of image analysis using machine learning should increase the accuracy and precision of abundance estimates from direct aerial counts (visible and thermal infrared, including from unmanned aerial vehicles [drones]) and motion‐sensitive cameras, and substantially reduce the time and cost burdens of manual image analysis.}}

Building on this insight, we explored the role of county characteristics in infl uencing the pattern and incidence of white-tailed deer- (Odocoileus virginianus) related auto collisions. Using county level data from 1994 to 2003 in Alabama, we tested several data models with the above mentioned factors as covariates. Our results showed that county characteristics, such as (1) having a deer population density (≥31/km 2 ), (2) being part of a metropolitan statistical area, (3) having a high proportion of pasture, urban and other land relative to woodland, and (4) having greater vehicle density per road km were more likely to increase the odds of deer-vehicle collisions. In contrast, high proportion of cropland relative to woodland, and wildlife management tools, such as increase in hunting license sales, and high deer bag limits, reduced the frequency of deer-vehicle collisions. These fi ndings suggested that urban planners need to consider the impact of urban development and infrastructure activities on deer habitat and densities, and how wildlife management strategies (e.g., judicious manipulation of bag limits and ways to promote hunting license sales) can be used along with other mitigation techniques to reduce deer-vehicle collisions.}}

Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have become increasingly popular for ungulate research; however, little is understood about how this novel technology compares with conventional methodologies for surveying wild populations. Aims We examined the feasibility of using a fixed-wing UAS equipped with a thermal infrared sensor for estimating the population density of wild white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (CCESR), Minnesota, USA. We compared UAS density estimates with those derived from faecal pellet-group counts. Methods We conducted UAS thermal survey flights from March to April of 2018 and January to March of 2019. Faecal pellet-group counts were conducted from April to May in 2018 and 2019. We modelled deer counts and detection probabilities and used these results to calculate point estimates and bootstrapped prediction intervals for deer density from UAS and pellet-group count data. We compared results of each survey approach to evaluate the relative efficacy of these two methodologies. Key results Our best-fitting model of certain deer detections derived from our UAS-collected thermal imagery produced deer density estimates (, 95% prediction interval=4.32–17.84 deerkm−2) that overlapped with the pellet-group count model when using our mean pellet deposition rate assumption (, 95% prediction interval=4.14–11.29 deerkm−2). Estimates from our top UAS model using both certain and potential deer detections resulted in a mean density of 13.77 deerkm−2 (95% prediction interval=6.64–24.35 deerkm−2), which was similar to our pellet-group count model that used a lower rate of pellet deposition (, 95% prediction interval=6.46–17.65 deerkm−2). The mean point estimates from our top UAS model predicted a range of 136.68–273.81 deer, and abundance point estimates using our pellet-group data ranged from 112.79 to 239.67 deer throughout the CCESR. Conclusions Overall, UAS yielded results similar to pellet-group counts for estimating population densities of wild ungulates; however, UAS surveys were more efficient and could be conducted at multiple times throughout the winter. Implications We demonstrated how UAS could be applied for regularly monitoring changes in population density. We encourage researchers and managers to consider the merits of UAS and how they could be used to enhance the efficiency of wildlife surveys.}}

Although great strides have been made in understanding this virus in cattle, little is known about the role of wildlife in the epidemiology of BVDV. While persistently infected cattle are the most important reservoir, free-ranging ungulates may become infected with BVDV as demonstrated by serosurveys and experimental infections. Therefore, free-ranging wildlife may maintain BVDV as the result of an independent cycle and may serve as a reservoir for the virus. Systematic studies on prevalence of BVDV-specific antibodies or frequency of persistent BVDV infection in North American wildlife are sparse, and no information is available from the southeastern United States. The objective of this study was to evaluate blood and skin samples from hunter-harvested white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for evidence of BVDV infection. Virus-neutralizing antibodies were detected in 2 of 165 serum samples. Skin biopsy immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on samples from 406 deer using a BVDV-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) (15c5), and BVDV antigen was detected in one sample. A similar IHC staining pattern was obtained using a second BVDV MAb (3.12F1). Viral antigen distribution in the skin sample of this deer resembled that found in persistently infected cattle and in a previously described persistently infected white-tailed deer; thus, the deer was presumed to be persistently infected. Evidence of BVDV infection in free-ranging white-tailed deer should encourage further systematic investigation of the prevalence of BVDV in wildlife.}}

However, in the agriculture-dominated lower Midwest and Great Plains, female dispersal also occurs. We examined the effects of the social and physical environment experienced by female fawns marked in central and northern Illinois, where dispersal rates were high (31%–61%) and forest cover occupied <5% of the county landscape. Dispersal probability was high for females born to subordinate mothers (25 of 26) and for fawns paired with a sibling that also dispersed (25 of 31). Females that dispersed came from populations with similar densities as those of females that remained sedentary. The lower dispersal rate for females born to dominant mothers suggests that the higher resource availability present within the home ranges of dominant mothers affects dispersal behavior. Subordinate mothers generally inhabit smaller, less secure ranges with fewer resources available to offspring. Resource availability appears to be one of the proximate factors influencing female fawn movement behavior.}}

Two techniques for dealing with such challenges have become established among agent-based modellers. The “ODD” (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol is a standard for describing ABMs in publications, but also provides design patterns for the model developer. ODD starts with an overview of what the model is and does, and then describes how the model implements ten “design concepts” that capture essential and unique characteristics of ABMs. Last come all the details needed to completely replicate the model. “Pattern-oriented modelling” (POM) is a set of strategies for using patterns observed in the systems to ensure that an ABM captures the right “essence” of the system. POM starts with identifying multiple patterns of behaviour in the real system and its agents that seem to capture the essential internal mechanisms for the problem being modelled. These patterns are then used to decide what kinds of entities, state variables, and processes need to be in the model; compare and test alternative “theory” for key agent behaviours; and filter potential parameter values to limit uncertainty. ODD and POM are important steps toward the acceptance of agent-based approaches as established, credible ways to do science.}}

The result is a rigorous, transparent, and values-driven process. This decision-aiding process provides the decision maker with a more complete understanding of the problem and the effects of potential management actions on stakeholder values, as well as how key uncertainties can affect the decision. We use a case study to illustrate how SDM can be used as a decision-aiding tool for management decision making at large scales. We evaluated alternative white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) buck-harvest regulations in New York designed to reduce harvest of yearling bucks, taking into consideration the values of the state wildlife agency responsible for managing deer, as well as deer hunters. We incorporated tradeoffs about social, ecological, and economic management concerns throughout the state. Based on the outcomes of predictive models, expert elicitation, and hunter surveys, the SDM process identified management alternatives that optimized competing objectives. The SDM process provided biologists and managers insight about aspects of the buck-harvest decision that helped them adopt a management strategy most compatible with diverse hunter values and management concerns.}}

To investigate influences of landscape features on dispersal patterns of a large mammal, we captured and radiomarked 363 juvenile male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), including 212 confirmed dispersers, in 2 topographically dissimilar study areas in Pennsylvania, USA. Dispersal azimuths were uniformly distributed in the western study area (WSA), where there was irregular, hilly topography. Mean dispersal azimuths paralleled ridge direction in the eastern study area, where long parallel ridges were aligned northeast-southwest. Major roads in both areas and a large river in the WSA were semipermeable barriers to dispersal of juvenile males; dispersal paths were less likely to intersect these linear features. Dispersal movements were direct and brief, typically lasting ,12 hours. For all dispersers, we found no evidence for preference or avoidance of establishing adult, postdispersal ranges in proximity to roads; however, deer that encountered roads near the terminus of their dispersal path were more likely to stop on the near side. Further, for deer that established postdispersal home ranges near major roads, these features influenced range placement such that locations were typically clustered on one side of the road. The influence of roads, rivers, and mountains on dispersal paths and postdispersal locations of white-tailed deer suggest that landscape-specific features should be considered in conservation and management of this and possibly other species of large mammals.}}

The objectives of our study were to compare size of home range for deer occupying a continuum of forested landscapes and to investigate relationships between size of home range and measures of landscape configuration. We used a movement-based kernel density estimator to estimate home range at five spatial scales among deer across study areas. We developed 7 linear regression models that used measures of the configuration of the forested landscape to explain size of home range. We observed differences in size of home range between sexes among areas that differed based on landscape configuration. We documented size of home range changed with various metrics that identifying connectivity of forested patches. Generally, size of home range increased with an increasing proportion of homogenous forest. Our results suggest that deer in our region occupy a landscape at hierarchically-nested scales that is controlled by the connectivity of the forested landscape across local or broad geographical regions.}}

Understanding how the landscape influences wildlife dispersal and pathogen epidemiology can enhance the efficacy of disease management in natural populations. We applied landscape genetics to examine relationships among landscape variables, dispersal of white-tailed deer hosts and transmission/spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal prion encephalopathy. Our focus was on quantifying movements and population structure of host deer in infected areas as a means of predicting the spread of this pathology and promoting its adaptive management. We analyzed microsatellite genotypes of CWD-infected and uninfected deer from two disease foci (Southern Wisconsin, Northern Illinois). We quantified gene flow and population structure using F ST, assignment tests, and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Gene flow estimates were then contrasted against a suite of landscape variables that potentially mediate deer dispersal. Forest fragmentation and grassland connectivity promoted deer movements while rivers, agricultural fields and large urbanized areas impeded movement. Landscape variables, deer dispersal, and disease transmission covaried significantly and positively in our analyses. Habitats with elevated host gene flow supported the concept of dispersal-mediated CWD transmission by reflecting a concomitant, rapid CWD expansion. Large, interrelated social groups isolated by movement barriers overlapped disease foci, suggesting that philopatry exacerbated CWD transmission. Our results promote adaptive management of CWD by predicting patterns of its spread and identifying habitats at risk for invasion. Further, our landscape genetics approach underscores the significance of topography and host behavior in wildlife disease transmission.}}

Among populations, inter- and intrasexual social cues for dispersal are thought to reduce inbreeding and local mate competition, respectively, and specific emigration cue may affect dispersal distance, such that inbreeding avoidance dispersal tends to be farther than dispersal to reduce local competition. To investigate potential occurrence of multiple proximate and ultimate causes of dispersal within populations, we radio-marked 363 juvenile male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in 2 study areas in Pennsylvania. Natal dispersal probability and distance were monitored over a 3-year period when large-scale management changes reduced density of adult females and increased density of adult males. Most dispersal (95--97%) occurred during two 12-week periods: spring, when yearling males still closely associate with related females, and prior to fall breeding season, when yearling males closely associate with other breeding-age males. Following changes to sex and age structure that reduced potential for inbreeding and increased potential for mate competition, annual dispersal probability did not change; however, probability of spring dispersal decreased, whereas probability of fall dispersal increased. Spring dispersal distances were greater than fall dispersal distances, suggesting that adaptive inbreeding avoidance dispersal requires greater distance than mate competition dispersal where opposite-sex relatives are philopatric and populations are not patchily distributed. Both inbreeding avoidance and mate competition are important ultimate causes of dispersal of white-tailed deer, but ultimate motivations for dispersal are proximately cued by different social mechanisms and elicit different responses in dispersers.

They inflict major economic losses in forestry, agriculture, and transportation and contribute to the transmission of several animal and human diseases. Their impact on natural ecosystems is also dramatic but less quantified. By foraging selectively, deer affect the growth and survival of many herb, shrub, and tree species, modifying patterns of relative abundance and vegetation dynamics. Cascading effects on other species extend to insects, birds, and other mammals. In forests, sustained overbrowsing reduces plant cover and diversity, alters nutrient and carbon cycling, and redirects succession to shift future overstory composition. Many of these simplified alternative states appear to be stable and difficult to reverse.

We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM), DeerLandscapeDisease (DLD), to investigate the effects of landscape structure, disease transmission, and management alternatives on dynamics of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ). We fitted biased random walk models to data from GPS-collared deer to simulate movements of individual deer and deer groups in an agricultural landscape with fragmented forest patches and a forest-dominated landscape. We estimated behavioral and demographic parameters from field data and published literature of deer ecology. We considered both direct and indirect transmission routes and assumed that bioavailability of infectious pathogens deposited in the environment decreased exponentially over time. We tuned transmission parameters to match observed trajectories of CWD prevalence in Wisconsin, and assumed that infection probability during an encounter was equal for all age classes. Thus, infection prevalence varied with sex- and age-specific behavior. DLD simulations demonstrated significant effects of landscape structure, social behavior and transmission mode on temporal changes in prevalence. Prevalence rose faster and reached higher levels in fragmented forest landscapes due to aggregation of deer within small forest patches. Furthermore, simulation results suggested that CWD might be driven through a mix of frequency- and density-dependent processes, potentially facilitating coexistence of CWD and deer populations. These results demonstrate the utility of ABMs and the importance of including spatial and behavioral heterogeneity when modeling disease transmission.}}

A problem, however, is that although convenient and cost-effective, hunter-harvest samples are not representative of the population due to heterogeneities in disease distribution and biased sampling. We developed an agent-based modeling framework that i) simulates a deer population in a user-generated landscape, and ii) uses a snapshot of the in silico deer population to simulate disease prevalence and distribution, harvest effort and sampling as per user-specified parameters. This framework can incorporate real-world heterogeneities in disease distribution, hunter harvest and harvest-based sampling, and therefore can be useful in informing wildlife disease surveillance strategies, specifically to determine population-specific sample sizes necessary for prompt detection of disease. Application of this framework is illustrated using the example of chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance in Missouri9s white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population. We show how confidence in detecting CWD is grossly overestimated under the unrealistic, but standard, assumptions that sampling effort and disease are randomly and independently distributed. We then provide adjusted sample size recommendations based on more realistic assumptions. Wildlife agencies can use these open-access models to design their CWD surveillance. Furthermore, these models can be readily adapted to other regions and other wildlife disease systems.}}

Projected deer population declines and concern about potential spread of CWD to other species warrant strategies to manage this disease. Control efforts to date have been largely unsuccessful, resulting in continuing spread and increasing prevalence. This systematic review summarizes peer-reviewed published reports describing field-applicable CWD control strategies in wild deer populations in North America using systematic review methods. Ten databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature. Following deduplication, relevance screening, full-text appraisal, subject matter expert review and qualitative data extraction, nine references were included describing four distinct management strategies. Six of the nine studies used predictive modeling to evaluate control strategies. All six demonstrated one or more interventions to be effective but results were dependant on parameters and assumptions used in the model. Three found preferential removal of CWD infected deer to be effective in reducing CWD prevalence; one model evaluated a test and slaughter strategy, the other selective removal of infected deer by predators and the third evaluated increased harvest of the sex with highest prevalence (males). Three models evaluated non-selective harvest of deer. There were only three reports that examined primary data collected as part of observational studies. Two of these studies supported the effectiveness of intensive non-selective culling; the third study did not find a difference between areas that were subjected to culling and those that were not. Seven of the nine studies were conducted in the United States. This review highlights the paucity of evaluated, field-applicable control strategies for CWD in wild deer populations. Knowledge gaps in the complex epidemiology of CWD and the intricacies inherent to prion diseases currently pose significant challenges to effective control of this disease in wild deer in North America.}}

Wildlife disease surveillance is the first line of defence against infectious disease. Fluctuations in host populations and disease prevalence are a known feature of wildlife disease systems.  However, the impact of such heterogeneities on the performance of surveillance is currently poorly understood.
 2. We present the first systematic exploration of the effects of fluctuations prevalence and host population size on the efficacy of wildlife disease surveillance systems. In this study efficacy is measured in terms of ability to estimate long term prevalence and detect disease risk.
 3. Our results suggest that for many wildlife disease systems fluctuations in population size and disease lead to bias in surveillance-based estimates of prevalence and over-confidence in assessments of both the precision of prevalence estimates and the power to detect disease.
 4. Neglecting such ecological effects may lead to poorly designed surveillance and ultimately to incorrect assessments of the risks posed by disease in wildlife. This will be most problematic in systems where prevalence fluctuations are large and disease fade-outs occur. Such fluctuations are determined by the interaction of demography and disease dynamics and although particularly likely in highly fluctuating populations typical of fecund short lived hosts, can’t be  ruled out in more stable populations of longer lived hosts.
 5. Synthesis and Applications: Fluctuations in population size and disease prevalence should be considered in the design and implementation of wildlife disease surveillance and the framework presented here provides a template for conducting suitable power calculations. Ultimately understanding the impact of fluctuations in demographic and epidemiological processes will enable improvements to wildlife disease surveillance systems leading to better characterisation of, and protection against endemic, emerging and re-emerging disease threats.}}

Bottom-up simulation models, i.e. individual-based and spatially explicit models, are powerful new tools in ecology and natural resource management. However, they have to be implemented as more or less complex software and are therefore harder to analyze, understand, and communicate than mathematical models. Particularly critical is the problem of communication, which must be solved if bottom-up models are to be scientifically credible. As a pragmatic solution to this problem, “visual debugging‘ is proposed, which means equipping simulation programs with a graphical user interface that integrates elements of conventional debugging and graphical representations of the model's state variables. The direct benefit of visual debugging is that the attitude of debugging, i.e. performing controlled experiments, is transferred to the overall development and analysis of the model. This facilitates acknowledging the hierarchical organization of ecological systems and using patterns observed in real systems for developing and validating the models. The benefit for communicating bottom-up models is that peers can download the executable program from the internet and test and analyze the model on their own. Visual debugging is not meant as an exclusive alternative to other approaches of communicating bottom-up simulation models, i.e. software libraries or general protocols of model description, but should be combined with these approaches. Overall, visual debugging integrates general principles of software engineering and specific requirements for modeling ecological systems and would therefore contribute to establishing an improved culture of analyzing, understanding, and communicating bottom-up simulation models.}}

Martin},doi={null},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={647932366},journal={null},abstract={In the context of ecological risk assessment of chemicals, individual-based population models hold great potential to increase the ecological realism of current regulatory risk assessment procedures. However, developing and parameterizing such models is time-consuming and often ad hoc. Using standardized, tested submodels of individual organisms would make individual-based modelling more efficient and coherent. In this thesis, I explored whether Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is suitable for being used as a standard submodel in individual-based models, both for ecological risk assessment and theoretical population ecology. First, I developed a generic implementation of DEB theory in an individual-based modeling (IBM) context: DEB-IBM. Using the DEB-IBM framework I tested the ability of the DEB theory to predict population-level dynamics from the properties of individuals. We used Daphnia magna as a model species, where data at the individual level was available to parameterize the model, and population-level predictions were compared against independent data from controlled population experiments. We found that DEB theory successfully predicted population growth rates and peak densities of experimental Daphnia populations in multiple experimental settings, but failed to capture the decline phase, when the available food per Daphnia was low. Further assumptions on food-dependent mortality of juveniles were needed to capture the population dynamics after the initial population peak. The resulting model then predicted, without further calibration, characteristic switches between small- and large-amplitude cycles, which have been observed for Daphnia. We conclude that cross-level tests help detecting gaps in current individual-level theories and ultimately will lead to theory development and the establishment of a generic basis for individual-based models and ecology. In addition to theoretical explorations, we tested the potential of DEB theory combined with IBMs to extrapolate effects of chemical stress from the individual to population level. For this we used information at the individual level on the effect of 3,4-dichloroanailine on Daphnia. The individual data suggested direct effects on reproduction but no significant effects on growth. Assuming such direct effects on reproduction, the model was able to accurately predict the population response to increasing concentrations of 3,4-dichloroaniline. We conclude that DEB theory combined with IBMs holds great potential for standardized ecological risk assessment based on ecological models.}}

Limiting mortality in the yearling (1–2 yr old) age class is a primary consideration, and regional differences in climate, habitat characteristics, hunting regulations, and hunter behavior complicate the understanding of how specific factors influence the risk of mortality. We used Cox proportional hazard modeling to determine the effects of body size, mean distance to road, dispersal behaviors, use of forested land, and use of land open to public hunting on the risk of mortality for a population of radio‐collared, yearling males ( n = 76) in Sussex County, Delaware, USA. Annual survival averaged 0.55 (95% CI = 0.45–0.68), with harvest accounting for 79% (26/33) of all mortalities. Measurements of body size (chest girth, shoulder height, and total length; cm) influenced dispersal probability but not dispersal distance. The best approximating model for mortality risk included a covariate for landownership, whereby mortality risk increased on public land. Among males who dispersed, longer‐distance dispersal was associated with reduced mortality, which contradicts previous research describing dispersal as a high‐risk behavior. The effect of landownership on mortality risk has not been previously identified, especially when regulations regarding harvest of yearling males are similar between landownership types. We observed annual survival rates of 0.69 (95% CI = 0.57–0.82) for deer apparently using private land exclusively during the hunting season, and 0.20 (95% CI = 0.11–0.48) for deer that used public land during the hunting season. Survival rates on private land were comparable to those of other regions actively managing male age structure. These results suggest survival of yearling males in the region is influenced by hunter harvest and the risks associated with dispersal may be minimal in areas where harvest pressure is low, although hunter harvest on public land may limit male age structure on a localized scale. © The Wildlife Society, 2019}}

We then employed Simpson9s diversity index to summarize  ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub-sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of recolonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a state-wide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas are also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories.}}

Moreover, CWD has been detected in captive cervids in South Korea and, in recent years, in free-ranging reindeer in Europe (Norway). Management of this disease is limited by logistical, financial, and sociopolitical considerations, and current strategies primarily focus on reducing host densities through hunter harvest and targeted culling. The success of such strategies in mitigating the spread and prevalence of CWD only upon detection is questionable. Here, we propose a proactive approach that emphasizes pre-emptive management through purposeful integration of virtual experiments (simulating alternate interventions as model scenarios) with the aim of evaluating their effectiveness. We use a published agent-based model that links white‐tailed deer demography and behavior with CWD transmission dynamics to first derive a CWD outbreak trajectory and then use the trajectory to highlight issues associated with different phases of the CWD outbreak (pre-establishment/transition/endemic). Specifically, we highlight the practical constraints on surveillance in the pre-establishment phase and recommend that agencies use a realistic detection threshold for their CWD surveillance programs. We further demonstrate that many disease introductions are ‘dead ends’ not leading to a full epidemic due to high stochasticity and harvesting in the pre-establishment phase of CWD. Model evaluated pre-emptive harvest strategies could increase the resilience of the deer population to CWD spread and establishment. We conclude it is important to adaptively position CWD management ahead of, rather than behind, the CWD front.}}

About 49 percent of the 367 fawns and 58 percent of the 742 older deer were females. As the hunt progressed, proportionately fewer of the deer alive each day were seen or harvested. Vulnerability to harvest varied by sex and age with 1.5and 2.5-year-old males initially the most susceptible animals to harvest. Patterns of behavior, association, and movement of the various sex-age groups are discussed as they relate to observed differential vulnerability. The relatively few hunters who admitted selectivity tended to select any adult over fawns rather than bucks over does. The ratio of harvested fawns to does stabilized at 85:100 after about 25 percent of the herd had been harvested. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 38(3):499-507 Harvested samples provide clues to the vital characteristics of exploited populations, but the game manager must be aware of potential biases caused by hunter selectivity and differential vulnerability of the animals to harvest (Quick 1958:441, Eberhardt 1969:461). This paper examines a controlled harvest of white-tailed deer from Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge in southern Illinois and attempts to answer the following questions: (1) Was vulnerability to harvest independent of cumulative hunting pressure and/or population density? (2) Was vulnerability to harvest independent of sex and age? (3) To what extent, if any, did hunters exercise selectivity, and how was this selectivity manifested? Data were obtained during 1-3, 7-9, and 14-17 January 1966, when 1,109 deer were removed from the closed portion of the Refuge (Roseberry et al. 1969). This herd had not been subjected to harvest since the first releases were made in 1942 and had been under intensive study since 1960 by the Cooperative Wildlife Research Laboratory of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. We acknowledge the staff of Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge and personnel of the Illinois Department of Conservation for their cooperation and assistance in making this study possible. Many graduate and undergraduate students of the Laboratory aided in the collection of data; especially helpful were J. Ludwig in age d termination of the deer and D. Autry throughout the entire study. R.

STUDY AREA AND METHODS The 43,000-acre (17,402-hectare) Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge is located primarily in Williamson County, Illinois. The western portion of the Refuge is a multiple-use area open to public utilization including deer hunting. The eastern 18,000 acres, which is the closed area, is nearly bisected into northern and southern halves by the eastern portion of Crab Orchard Lake. Habitat and land use have been previously described (Autry 1967, Hawkins and Klimstra 1970). J. Wildl.

A total of 428 hunt stations were rather evenly distributed throughout the area, but only 300 were occupied concurrently. Hunters used only shotguns with slugs and were not allowed to move more than 50 yards (46 m) from their designated stands. Stations were occupied continuously as successful hunters were replaced by alternates. Weather during the 10 days of the hunt was variable. Daily highs averaged about 44 F (27-63) and daily lows 25 F (10-50). A hard, steady rain fell throughout the opening day and was accompanied by temperatures in the mid-fifties. Some rain also fell during the morning of the 2nd day; high temperatures were in the low sixties. No more rainfall occurred during the remainder of the hunt. Cloud cover was 100 percent on the 1st, 8th, and 9th day, over 75 percent on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 10th day, between 40 and 50 percent on the 3rd and 7th day, and 9 percent on the 5th day (Unpublished data, Southern Illinois Airport, Carbondale). All harvested deer were brought to check stations where each animal was processed, including the collection of a lower jaw and eyeball for purposes of age determination. Of the total sample of 1,109 animals, 1,026 were segregated into yearly age classes. Ages of most were determined by tooth eruption and wear (Severinghaus 1949); some fawns were identified on the basis of body and/or eye lens weight. For the present analysis, all deer judged to have been 3.5 years and older were grouped into one age class (3.5+) for each sex in order to increase sample sizes and because segregation into older yearly age classes is somewhat subjective. Eighty-three jaws, or 7.5 percent of the sample, were inadvertantly destroyed; these deer were identified as fawns or older on the basis of body and/or eye lens weight. The unknown-age adults were separated into three classes (1.5, 2.5, 3.5+) in similar proportion to "known-age" deer of like sex harvested on the same day. For most analyses, each day of the hunt was considered an individual sampling period. For certain comparisons, however, harvest data were pooled for days showing the greatest similarities of sex and age composition and grouped into four periods. These periods were: opening day (1 January), the next 2 days of opening weekend (2-3 January), the 2nd weekend (7-9 January), and the 3rd weekend (14-17 January). In order to compare rates of harvest and sightings with population density, the number of deer present each day of the hunt was estimated and the percentage of those seen and harvested per unit effort was calculated (hereafter referred to as relative sighting or harvest rates). Man-hours in the field and number of deer observed daily were obtained by interviewing each hunter as he returned from the field. Throughout this paper, the term "available" deer refers to those animals presumed alive on any given day whereas the term "vulnerability" refers to the probability of their harvest on that day. The number of deer considered available each day represented the mean of the number of animals alive at the beginning and end of that day. The number of deer considered removed from the population on any day equaled the known harvest plus the estimated crippling loss; the latter was assumed to have occurred in the same proportion as the harvest on that particular day. Thus Xi = 2Y_ [Hi + (HC1/H,)] J. Wildl.

For purposes of estimating prehunt (and thus daily) population levels of the various sex and age groups, it was necessary to assume that the composition of the total harvested sample was representative of prehunt conditions. It was further assumed that the estimated crippling loss for any given day was distributed among the sex and age groups in the same proportion as was the harvest on that day. A prehunt population estimate of 2,250 or 1 deer/8 acres (Autry 1969:8) was used as the number of animals alive at the beginning of the first day. However, the accuracy of this estimate is not relevant to the analysis of changes in vulnerability. In other words, the prehunt population size could have been designated as X and each daily level as X minus the cumulative harvest without altering the basic form of the relationships established. Linear and curvilinear regression lines were fitted by the method of least squares using multiple regression techniques and an IBM 370/155 computer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Harvests of previously protected herds usually show a higher percentage of females than males among deer older than fawns (Murphy 1962:42, Krefting and Erickson 1956:301, Krefting et al. 1955:350). The Crab Orchard harvest was no exception, as 58.4 percent of the yearlings and adults taken were females: a significant (P < 0.001) departure from a 50:50 sex ratio Table 1.

Human actors play a pivotal role in SESs, but their interactions with each other and their environment are often underrepresented in SES modelling. We argue that more attention should be given to social aspects in models of SESs, but this entails additional kinds of complexity. Modelling choices need to be as transparent as possible, and to be based on analysis of the purposes and limitations of modelling. We recommend thinking in terms of modelling projects rather than single models. Such a project may involve multiple models adopting different modelling methods. We argue that agent-based models (ABMs) are an essential tool in an SES modelling project, but their expressivity, which is their major advantage, also produces problems with model transparency and validation. We propose the use of formal ontologies to make the structure and meaning of models as explicit as possible, facilitating model design, implementation, assessment, comparison and extension.}}

We examine individual-based ecology (IBE), a research paradigm that promises better a predictive ability by using individual-based models (IBMs) to represent ecological dynamics as arising from how individuals interact with their environment and with each other. A key advantage of IBMs is that the basis for predictions—fitness maximization by individual organisms—is more general and reliable than the empirical relationships that other models depend on. Case studies illustrate the usefulness and predictive success of long-term IBE programs. The pioneering programs had three phases: conceptualization, implementation, and diversification. Continued validation of models runs throughout these phases. The breakthroughs that make IBE more productive include standards for describing and validating IBMs, improved and standardized theory for individual traits and behavior, software tools, and generalized instead of system-specific IBMs. We provide guidelines for pursuing IBE and a vision for future IBE research.}}

Deer hunters comprise a substantial portion of recreational hunters in the United States, and numerous stakeholders benefit from the deer management services provided by hunters on public lands. We estimated the economic value of publicly accessible deer hunting land in Michigan using economic models of hunting destinations for hunters in the archery season and for hunters in the firearm season. We found that the amounts of state-owned hunting land, federally owned hunting land, and publicly accessible, privately owned Commercial Forest Act land are significant (P < 0.001) and positive determinants of hunting destinations. The annual economic value of Michigan's publicly accessible hunting land to archery and firearm deer hunters, beyond hunter expenditures, was estimated to be over $80 million. Access to state- owned land accounted for approximately $50 million in annual economic value to Michigan deer hunters. The average per-acre value of publicly accessible hunting land is greatest in the Southern Lower Peninsula of Michigan, where public access is scarce and the majority of hunters reside. Understanding the economic values hunters derive from publicly accessible hunting lands will enable managers and policy makers to make better decisions when considering policy options that involve reducing or increasing public access. 2011 The Wildlife Society.}}

As with natural predators, several environmental factors can influence sport harvest. A better understanding of the environmental variables that limit the efficiency of sport hunting could provide guidelines for more efficient wildlife management using hunting. We studied white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunting on a high deer density island where hunting was the sole form of predation. Our objective was to study the behavior of sport hunters and determine the habitat characteristics (e.g., abundance of deer forage, visibility of the deer from the hunter's point of view, and accessibility of the territory to hunters) that are associated with a successful harvest. We collected movements and harvest site location data from 477 hunters equipped with handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) units. Harvest sites were visited and characterized, along with a paired random site, to determine the environmental conditions associated with a successful hunt. We also developed a model to predict the daily number of deer seen by hunters considering weather conditions, hunter characteristics (e.g., age, experience), and date of hunting. We used the mean number of deer seen per hunter per day as a relative index of local density in each hunted territory. At both the site and landscape scales, the combination of visibility and access had a positive effect on the distribution of harvested deer. Habitat types with less visual obstruction from vegetation enabled hunters to see more deer in a given day. At the site scale, harvested deer were located in areas with a lower density of access routes compared to areas where hunters travelled throughout the day. Using an innovative approach of studying hunter behavior with GPS technology, digital maps, and questionnaires, we highlighted the factors associated with hunter success. Our study suggests that habitat characteristics could be modified to increase harvest by improving accessibility and visibility near roads. Creating openings in mature and regenerating forest near access roads could make sport hunting a more efficient management tool, but the potential impact of increased forage availability in forest openings should not be overlooked. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.}}

Waller},doi={null},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={2339349966},journal={Wildlife Society Bulletin},abstract={During the last 3 centuries, sweeping manipulations of habitat for agriculture, silviculture, and, to a lesser degree, game management have improved and expanded habitat for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) across much of the landscape in the eastern United States. For most of this century, wildlife managers sought to protect and enhance populations of deer. With the specter of extirpation still haunting their memory, wildlife managers worked hard in the early 20th century to devise and enforce bag limits, short hunting seasons, and buckonly hunts in order to protect the recovering herds. As they professionalized, wildlife managers were quick to follow Leopold's (1933) suggestion that the way to manage game is to manage habitat. For whitetailed deer, this meant favoring edge and early successional habitats by creating gaps and grassy openings in regions dominated by mature forest. Clearcuts, in particular, continue to be promoted for their immediate production of slash for browse and their ready succession to shade-intolerant species such as aspen (Populus spp.) that provide good summer browse, at least for a few years (e.g., Masters et al. 1993, Johnson et al. 1995). Nearly a decade ago, we warned wildlife professionals and conservation biologists about the ecological consequences of overabundant deer populations (Alverson et al. 1988). Since then, deer populations and their ecological and economic impacts appear to have increased and worsened. As we approach the next millennium, it behooves wildlife managers to contemplate what consequences will result from their actions in their own professional lifetimes. We hear more each year about the high costs of crop and tree-seedling damage, deer-vehicle collisions, and nuisance deer in suburban locales (Conover et al. 1995). Beyond these substantial economic costs, however, we face new and often vexing issues regarding the ecological costs of overabundant deer. In some cases, it appears that these consequences will extend over decades and perhaps even centuries. This makes it even more important now than it was a decade ago that wildlife managers assume responsibility and take action to minimize the ecological effects of chronically overabundant deer populations. The wildlife management profession has begun to respond to the economic and ecological impacts of overabundant deer. In 1995, Wisconsin's Bureau of Wildlife elected to scrutinize the impacts of its own deer management policies via a comprehensive Environmental Assessment (VanderZouwen and Warnke 1995). This was the first attempt, that we are aware of, to seriously consider the broad range of ecological and environmental impacts pertaining to a state's deer management policy. Partly in response to this assessment, the Wildlife Bureau also began to institute new hunting regulations in some areas to ensure that more, especially more female, deer were killed (e.g., their 1996 "Earn a Buck" program). This, however, has proved to be a major challenge, both because it is difficult to adjust hunter effort as more areas become off-limits to hunting and because hunters favor a tradition and management they see as contributing to, rather than diminishing, their prospects for personal hunting success. Many hunters remain skeptical about the seriousness of deer impacts, or at least the need to reduce deer densities in their own areas (Diefenbach et al. 1997). Thus, in addition to facing the irony of having done their job too well,}}

However, in the southern United States the breeding season of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is relatively heterogeneous over short distances. To test the hypothesis that genetic differences account for heterogeneity in breeding dates, we compared the degree of mitochondrial (mtDNA) and microsatellite DNA differentiation among 6 pairs of adjacent populations with breeding dates differing by an average of 35 days (DBD group) and 4 pairs of populations displaying similar breeding dates (SBD group) differing by no more than 2 days. Average mtDNA differentiation between pairs in the DBD group (FST=0.408, SD=0.190) was larger (P=0.03) than for the SBD group (FST=0.140, SD=0.092). The average differentiation at biparentally inherited microsatellite loci within the SBD group (FST=0.028, SD=0.021) did not differ from that observed for the DBD group (FST=0.047, SD=0.024; P=0.200). The similarity at biparentally inherited loci suggests that there are no cryptic barriers and populations are connected by male dispersal. The greater differences in mtDNA lineages between geographically proximate populations in the DBD group imply a maternal genetic effect on the timing of breeding, likely maintained by female philopatry. We hypothesize that this difference is a genetic legacy of restocking efforts and the recovery of remnant localized populations. Translocation efforts require careful consideration of differences between source and recipient populations. Breeding dates that differ among some proximate southern deer populations may be a fixed trait that must be considered when establishing management objectives and harvest criteria. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.}}

Initialized with realistic or artificial land use maps, the ecological-economic model will advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the trade-offs and synergies of ecological and economic functions in tropical landscapes.}}
