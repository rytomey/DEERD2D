## Introduction

White-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) have long been a focal species in North American wildlife management, valued for their ecological, cultural, and economic importance [@hewitt_2015; @enck_2003]. Their recovery from near-extirpation in the early 20th century—driven by restocking programs, regulatory reforms, and the development of the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation—remains one of the most celebrated conservation achievements [@hanberry_2020; @barick_1951; @halls_1984; @mccullough_1979]. This model, which designates wildlife as a public trust resource and legitimizes regulated hunting as a management tool, has guided policy and practice for more than a century [@hewitt_2015; @miller_1995]. However, the ecological, social, and political context of deer management in the 21st century presents novel challenges that differ markedly from those of the past [@game2014; @ditchkoff2025].

Emerging infectious diseases pose some of the most pressing threats to deer populations and management objectives. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and meningeal worm can cause substantial mortality, reduce recruitment, and alter population dynamics [@belsare_2020; @passler_2008; @passler_2009; @mysterud_2021]. The spread and persistence of these pathogens are influenced by environmental change, captive cervid operations, and anthropogenic translocations [@belsare_2020; @brandell_2022]. Surveillance and control efforts are frequently hindered by biased sampling, resource limitations, and sociopolitical resistance to management interventions [@brandell_2022; @game_2014].

Climate change is further reshaping the distribution, behavior, and health of deer populations [@bakshi_2024; @hanberry_2019]. Northward range expansion into historically deer-free areas such as Alaska has introduced novel ecological interactions, altered predator–prey dynamics, and increased the potential for pathogen emergence in naïve ecosystems [@hanberry_2019; @boucher_2025]. In many regions, these changes occur against a backdrop of stakeholder skepticism toward climate science, creating tension between agency priorities and constituent values [@kansky_2025].

Socioeconomic factors compound these ecological challenges. Declining hunter participation—a trend driven by demographic shifts, competing recreational opportunities, and changing cultural attitudes—threatens the primary funding mechanism for state wildlife agencies through hunting license sales and Pittman–Robertson excise taxes [@enck_2003; @nda_2025]. Distrust in government institutions and science denial among some stakeholder groups can erode compliance with regulations and support for management actions [@urbanek_2011; @scofield_2002]. In some cases, political or economic pressures may disincentivize disease surveillance or reporting if such findings could reduce hunter engagement and agency revenue [@draper_2025].

Management strategies vary widely among jurisdictions, reflecting differences in ecological conditions, disease prevalence, and sociopolitical context [@missouridmp_2025; @minnesotadmp_2018; @wiskirchen_2023]. Programs such as Deer Management Assistance Programs (DMAP) can improve landowner–agency collaboration but also generate conflict where objectives diverge [@pruitt_2023; @wiskirchen_2023]. The increasing overlap of deer with agricultural lands, urban areas, and mixed-ownership landscapes further complicates management by introducing diverse and sometimes competing stakeholder priorities [@tack_2017; @forsyth_2022].

Accurate and defensible population assessment is foundational to deer management. Historically, agencies have relied on approaches such as Sex-Age-Kill (SAK), Simple Population Reconstruction (SPR), and matrix-based models [@caswell_2014; @norton_2015]. While these methods are operationally straightforward, they often depend on restrictive assumptions, lack flexibility, and may not capture the stochasticity, spatial heterogeneity, or behavioral complexity of deer populations [@forsyth_2022; @brandell_2022]. Advances in ecological modeling—particularly Bayesian state-space models, integrated population models (IPMs), and agent-based models (ABMs)—offer more robust ways to incorporate uncertainty, combine disparate data sources, and simulate individual-level processes [@schaub2007; @plard2019; @belsare2020; @nagyreis2021]. However, these methods require greater computational resources, technical expertise, and often extensive datasets [@cegielski2016; @robinson2016].

Technological innovation is expanding the scope and scale of data collection. Telemetry devices have become lighter, more accurate, and less invasive [@saalfeld2007; @jackson2013]; camera traps paired with artificial intelligence are streamlining species detection and classification [@beery2019; @pricetack2016; @mulero2025]; and unmanned aerial systems are providing novel perspectives on distribution and abundance [@lyu2024]. Cloud-based platforms and open-source software such as R, GitHub, NetLogo, and Shiny, as well as field-data applications like ArcGIS Field Maps and Survey123, are facilitating real-time monitoring, collaborative modeling, and reproducible workflows [@jones2024; @forsyth2022]. Despite these advances, barriers remain in standardizing protocols, ensuring reproducibility, and making tools accessible to diverse agencies with varying resources [@forsyth2022; @brandell2022].

Given the multifaceted challenges of the 21st century, reliance on a single modeling framework is increasingly inadequate for supporting adaptive management. A pluralistic approach that integrates multiple modeling tools—each contributing unique strengths—can improve inference, highlight uncertainty, and increase the transparency and defensibility of management decisions [@starfield1997; @robinson2016]. This “toolbox” perspective, akin to Ani’s “Rule of 3,” emphasizes the value of modular frameworks capable of addressing diverse management contexts while remaining adaptable to new data and changing conditions.

By situating current deer management within its historical context and integrating ecological, technological, and sociopolitical dimensions, this synthesis underscores the urgent need for adaptive, data-driven, and stakeholder-inclusive strategies to sustain white-tailed deer populations in an era of unprecedented change.
