# Chapter 1: White-tailed Deer Management in the 21st Century

## Chapter Objective

-   Conduct a conceptual synthesis of white-tailed deer (WTD) population
    modeling and monitoring tools as they relate to management
    decision-making in the 21st century.\
-   Evaluate the evolution of analytical approaches, identify persistent
    limitations, and synthesize a pluralistic, reproducible framework
    for state agency decision-making.\

Produce a generalizable **decision-making framework** that integrates
multiple modeling approaches to address contemporary management
challenges.

### Introduction and Rationale

-   Turning point in management: shifting from restoration and harvest
    regulation to disease control, hunter recruitment/retention, climate
    change adaptation, and sociopolitical considerations.\
-   Current decision-making often shaped by legacy approaches from the
    20th century, despite changing ecological and social contexts.\

Absence of a standardized, transparent, and reproducible framework
hinders agency capacity to make defensible, adaptive decisions.

## \### Historical Foundations

-   Major management eras:
    -   *Exploitation and near-extirpation* (pre-1900s)\
    -   *Restoration and recovery* (1910s–1950s)\
    -   *Population expansion and Quality Deer Management*
        (1970s–2000s)\
    -   *Contemporary era* (2010s–present) — marked by disease
        emergence, declining hunter participation, and broader
        environmental change.\
-   Role of the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation in shaping
    funding structures, public trust mandates, and harvest regulation.\

Legacy effects: how past successes and institutional frameworks
constrain modern adaptation.

### Contemporary Management Challenges

-   **Ecological and epidemiological drivers**: CWD, EHD, bovine TB,
    Lyme disease, climate-driven range shifts.\

-   **Sociocultural pressures**: declining hunter numbers, shifting
    demographics, urbanization, changing stakeholder expectations.\

-   **Political and institutional constraints**: policy inertia,
    mistrust in agencies, stakeholder polarization.\

-   **Private–public land management tensions**: DMAP programs,
    cooperative data sharing, and regulatory consistency.

    ### Current Decision-Support Practices

-   Dominance of harvest-based monitoring: Statistical Population
    Reconstruction (SPR), Sex–Age–Kill (SAK) models — data needs,
    assumptions, scalability.\

-   Supplementary and alternative data sources:

    -   Camera trap surveys, including citizen science integration\
    -   Roadkill/incidental mortality reports\
    -   Telemetry and GPS collar data\
    -   Hunter effort and satisfaction surveys\

Integration potential: double-sampling designs, linking low-resolution
extensive data with intensive localized datasets.

### Evolution of Population Modeling Approaches

-   **Traditional approaches**: SAK, SPR, matrix models — strengths and
    weaknesses in informing harvest policy.\

-   **Modern approaches**:

    -   Bayesian hierarchical/state-space models\
    -   Spatially explicit agent-based models (ABMs)\
    -   Hybrid and modular models combining elements of both\

-   **Evaluation criteria**:

    -   Data requirements and availability\
    -   Interpretability for managers/stakeholders\
    -   Cost/logistical feasibility\
    -   Flexibility to evaluate alternative scenarios\

-   Reproducibility and transparency

    ### Toward a Pluralistic “Bouquet of Tools”

-   Rationale for modular frameworks over single-model dependence.\

-   Ani’s “Rule of 3”: no model can answer all questions; multiple
    complementary tools are needed to address the full decision space.\

Mapping model types to decision needs (e.g., harvest optimization,
disease risk assessment, habitat change impacts).

### Gaps and Opportunities

-   Lack of reproducible workflows and standardization across agencies.\
-   Underuse of citizen science and participatory monitoring in formal
    frameworks.\
-   Limited cross-jurisdictional data integration and sharing.\

Opportunities for cloud-based, interactive decision-support tools (e.g.,
Shiny, GitHub-hosted workflows) to democratize access and facilitate
adaptive management.

### Final Synthesis: Proposed Decision-Making Framework

-   Core principles: generalizability, precision, reproducibility,
    transparency, and adaptability.\
-   Integration of multiple data streams with complementary modeling
    approaches.\
-   Explicit documentation of assumptions, uncertainty, and trade-offs
    in decision outcomes.\
-   Framework designed for scalability across spatial (property, zone,
    state) and temporal (annual, decadal) scales.\
-   Intended as a **decision-support blueprint** for state wildlife
    agencies to guide defensible and adaptive WTD management in the 21st
    century.

## Chapter 2: Building a Modeling Framework for Deer Management

**Objective**:

-   Build an adaptable population modeling framework using Alabama as
    the initial focus, centered around an ABM and designed for eventual
    transferability to other states or contexts.

**Main Points**:

-   Outline of available harvest data, cooperator check station records,
    and decision workflows currently used by Alabama DWFF.

-   ABM built using ODD protocol as the foundation using available data
    in AL representing spatial harvest dynamics, deer life-history, and
    hunter behavior.

-   Integrate other modeling and methods (e.g., spreadsheet
    deterministic models can help initialize or calibrate the ABM)

-   Scenario-based evaluation: simulate the impact of regulatory changes
    (e.g., season length, bag limits, spatial scale, demographic ratios)
    on deer population structure and harvest outcomes.

-   Use trade-off analysis to visualize how decisions might perform
    across multiple agency objectives (e.g., age structure, harvest
    numbers, effort).

**Alternatives and Additions**:

-   Demonstrate generalizability by applying model structure to a second
    southeastern state using their data templates. (motivation for
    participatory effort from DWFF)

-   Include scenarios with a decline in hunting participation and
    explore alternative approaches (e.g., landowner incentives,
    recruitment-focused efforts).

## Chapter 3

## Option A: Integrating Evaluating Nontraditional Data for Modeling and Monitoring

**Objective**:

-   Assess the potential to incorporate and validate wildlife population
    models using existing data sources that are publicly available

**Main Points**:

-   Categorize data by structure: traditional (cooperator harvest),
    semi-structured (camera projects), and unstructured (e.g., social
    media, opportunistic sightings).

-   Test how these data could validate model predictions or refine
    parameter estimates.

-   Build feedback loops where outputs from simulations inform
    priorities for new data collection, and vice versa.

-   Consider implementation challenges such as standardization, storage,
    legal concerns.

-   Highlight automation opportunities (e.g., ML image classification),
    and future surveillance systems that enable more responsive
    management.

**Alternatives and Additions**:

-   Focus in on trail cameras as a case study—building off recent
    applications in avian monitoring (e.g., Jonathon’s bird point work).

## Option B: Designing Modeling Tools and Data Systems with State Agencies and Stakeholders

**Objective**:

-   Work directly with Alabama DWFF and other stakeholders to co-develop
    usable, trusted, and streamlined data systems and modeling
    interfaces.

**Main Points**:

-   Identify what data is already collected (e.g., antler points, age
    estimates) and evaluate how it could feed into a modeling workflow.

-   Propose centralized workflows to reduce archived or inconsistent
    data collection (e.g., digital entry from the field, real-time
    dashboards).

-   Conduct interviews or surveys with hunters, landowners, and agency
    staff to understand trust in models, desired outputs, and
    transparency needs.

## Option C: Modeling Stressor Interactions and Regulatory Trade-Offs in Southeastern Deer Populations

**Objective**:

-   Extend the ABM to simulate how interacting population stressors such
    as disease outbreaks, habitat degradation, and invasive
    species—could shape management outcomes and risk-based
    decision-making.

**Main Points**:

-   Overview of stressors: CWD, EHD, tick-borne burdens, drought
    effects, competition with pigs.

-   Link stressor events to modeled dynamics (e.g., how reduced forage +
    high density = higher disease prevalence).

-   Simulate compounding scenarios (e.g., drought year + reduced hunter
    effort + EHD outbreak).

-   Evaluate cross-boundary impacts from local disturbances.

-   Model surveillance strategies and adaptive regulation

-   Include uncertainty analysis: how risk tolerance and unknowns could
    shift decision thresholds.
