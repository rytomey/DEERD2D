With new tools and mechanisms for engaging learners, citizen science pushes the envelope of what ecologists can achieve, both in expanding the potential for spatial ecology research and in supplementing existing, but localized, research programs. The primary impacts of citizen science are seen in biological studies of global climate change, including analyses of phenology, landscape ecology, and macro‐ecology, as well as in sub‐disciplines focused on species (rare and invasive), disease, populations, communities, and ecosystems. Citizen science and the resulting ecological data can be viewed as a public good that is generated through increasingly collaborative tools and resources, while supporting public participation in science and Earth stewardship.}

abstract = {Demographic data of rare and endangered species are often too sparse to estimate vital rates and population size with sufficient precision for understanding population growth and decline. Yet, the combination of different sources of demographic data into one statistical model holds promise. We applied Bayesian integrated population modeling to demographic data from a colony of the endangered greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). Available data were the number of subadults and adults emerging from the colony roost at dusk, the number of newborns from 1991 to 2005, and recapture data of subadults and adults from 2004 and 2005. Survival rates did not differ between sexes, and demographic rates remained constant across time. The greater horseshoe bat is a long-lived species with high survival rates (first year: 0.49 [{SD} 0.06]; adults: 0.91 [{SD} 0.02]) and low fecundity (0.74 [{SD} 0.12]). The yearly average population growth was 4.4\% ({SD} 0.1\%) and there were 92 ({SD} 10) adults in the colony in year 2005. Had we analyzed each data set separately, we would not have been able to estimate fecundity, the estimates of survival would have been less precise, and the estimate of population growth biased. Our results demonstrate that integrated models are suitable for obtaining crucial demographic information from limited data.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Proteins, individual cells, and cell populations denote different levels of an organizational hierarchy, each of which with its own dynamics. Multi-level modeling is concerned with describing a system at these different levels and relating their dynamics. Rule-based modeling has increasingly attracted attention due to enabling a concise and compact description of biochemical systems. In addition, it allows different methods for model analysis, since more than one semantics can be defined for the same syntax. {RESULTS}: Multi-level modeling implies the hierarchical nesting of model entities and explicit support for downward and upward causation between different levels. Concepts to support multi-level modeling in a rule-based language are identified. To those belong rule schemata, hierarchical nesting of species, assigning attributes and solutions to species at each level and preserving content of nested species while applying rules. Further necessities are the ability to apply rules and flexibly define reaction rate kinetics and constraints on nested species as well as species that are nested within others. An example model is presented that analyses the interplay of an intracellular control circuit with states at cell level, its relation to cell division, and connections to intercellular communication within a population of cells. The example is described in {ML}-Rules - a rule-based multi-level approach that has been realized within the plug-in-based modeling and simulation framework {JAMES} {II}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Rule-based languages are a suitable starting point for developing a concise and compact language for multi-level modeling of cell biological systems. The combination of nesting species, assigning attributes, and constraining reactions according to these attributes is crucial in achieving the desired expressiveness. Rule schemata allow a concise and compact description of complex models. As a result, the presented approach facilitates developing and maintaining multi-level models that, for instance, interrelate intracellular and intercellular dynamics.}

abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess, "given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species--the subject matter of community ecology--are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal to drive community dynamics.}

abstract = {Bovine viral diarrhea virus ({BVDV}) is one of the most relevant pathogens affecting today's cattle industries. Although great strides have been made in understanding this virus in cattle, little is known about the role of wildlife in the epidemiology of {BVDV}. While persistently infected cattle are the most important reservoir, free-ranging ungulates may become infected with {BVDV} as demonstrated by serosurveys and experimental infections. Therefore, free-ranging wildlife may maintain {BVDV} as the result of an independent cycle and may serve as a reservoir for the virus. Systematic studies on prevalence of {BVDV}-specific antibodies or frequency of persistent {BVDV} infection in North American wildlife are sparse, and no information is available from the southeastern United States. The objective of this study was to evaluate blood and skin samples from hunter-harvested white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for evidence of {BVDV} infection. Virus-neutralizing antibodies were detected in 2 of 165 serum samples. Skin biopsy immunohistochemistry ({IHC}) was performed on samples from 406 deer using a {BVDV}-specific monoclonal antibody ({MAb}) (15c5), and {BVDV} antigen was detected in one sample. A similar {IHC} staining pattern was obtained using a second {BVDV} {MAb} (3.{12F1}). Viral antigen distribution in the skin sample of this deer resembled that found in persistently infected cattle and in a previously described persistently infected white-tailed deer; thus, the deer was presumed to be persistently infected. Evidence of {BVDV} infection in free-ranging white-tailed deer should encourage further systematic investigation of the prevalence of {BVDV} in wildlife.}

abstract = {Concern about the ecological consequences of global change has increasingly stimulated ecologists to examine the futures of ecological systems. Studying futures is not only a crucial element of the interaction between science, management and decision making, but also a critical research challenge per se, especially because futures cannot be observed or experimented on. In addition, researchers can encounter methodological and theoretical difficulties, which make interpretations and predictions problematic. In the literature which deals with futures of ecological systems two main lines of research can be distinguished: a predictive approach, which dominates the literature, can be contrasted with a rarer number of studies that elaborate potential scenarios for ecological systems. Scenario approaches currently concern mainly contacts with stakeholders or decision makers, or the use of climate scenarios to derive projections about ecological futures. We argue that a new direction for ecological futures research could be explored by using ecological scenarios in combination with predictive models to further fundamental ecological research, in addition to enhancing its applied value.}

A problem, however, is that although convenient and cost-effective, hunter-harvest samples are not representative of the population due to heterogeneities in disease distribution and biased sampling. We developed an agent-based modeling framework that i) simulates a deer population in a user-generated landscape, and ii) uses a snapshot of the in silico deer population to simulate disease prevalence and distribution, harvest effort and sampling as per user-specified parameters. This framework can incorporate real-world heterogeneities in disease distribution, hunter harvest and harvest-based sampling, and therefore can be useful in informing wildlife disease surveillance strategies, specifically to determine population-specific sample sizes necessary for prompt detection of disease. Application of this framework is illustrated using the example of chronic wasting disease ({CWD}) surveillance in Missouri's white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population. We show how confidence in detecting {CWD} is grossly overestimated under the unrealistic, but standard, assumptions that sampling effort and disease are randomly and independently distributed. We then provide adjusted sample size recommendations based on more realistic assumptions. Wildlife agencies can use these open-access models to design their {CWD} surveillance. Furthermore, these models can be readily adapted to other regions and other wildlife disease systems.}

abstract = {Population dynamics models have long assumed that populations are composed of a restricted number of groups, where individuals in each group have identical demographic rates and where all groups are similarly affected by density-dependent and -independent effects. However, individuals usually vary tremendously in performance and in their sensitivity to environmental conditions or resource limitation, such that individual contributions to population growth will be highly variable. Recent efforts to integrate individual processes in population models open up new opportunities for the study of eco-evolutionary processes, such as the density-dependent influence of environmental conditions on the evolution of morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits. We review recent advances that demonstrate how including individual mechanisms in models of population dynamics contributes to a better understanding of the drivers of population dynamics within the framework of integrated population models ({IPMs}). {IPMs} allow for the integration in a single inferential framework of different data types as well as variable population structure including sex, social group, or territory, all of which can be formulated to include individual-level processes. Through a series of examples, we first show how {IPMs} can be beneficial for getting more accurate estimates of demographic traits than classic matrix population models by including basic population structure and their influence on population dynamics. Second, the integration of individual- and population-level data allows estimating density-dependent effects along with their inherent uncertainty by directly using the population structure and size to feedback on demography. Third, we show how {IPMs} can be used to study the influence of the dynamics of continuous individual traits and individual quality on population dynamics. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of {IPMs} for integrating data at different spatial, temporal, and organismal levels to build more mechanistic models of population dynamics. \copyright 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.}

abstract = {Epidemiological surveillance for many important wildlife diseases relies on samples obtained from hunter-harvested animals. Statistical methods used to calculate sample size requirements assume that the target population is randomly sampled, and therefore the samples are representative of the population. But hunter-harvested samples may not be representative of the population due to disease distribution heterogeneities (e.g. spatial clustering of infected individuals), and harvest-related non-random processes like regulations, hunter selectivity, variable land access, and uneven hunter distribution. Consequently, sample sizes necessary for detection of disease are underestimated and disease detection probabilities are overestimated, resulting in erroneous inferences about disease presence and distribution. We have developed a modeling framework to support the design of efficient disease surveillance programs for wildlife populations. The constituent agent-based models can incorporate real-world heterogeneities associated with disease distribution, harvest, and harvest-based sampling, and can be used to determine population-specific sample sizes necessary for prompt detection of important wildlife diseases like chronic wasting disease and bovine tuberculosis. The modeling framework and its application has been described in detail by Belsare et al. [1]. Here we describe how model scenarios were developed and implemented, and how model outputs were analyzed. The main objectives of this methods paper are to provide users the opportunity to a) assess the reproducibility of the published model results, b) gain an in-depth understanding of model analysis, and c) facilitate adaptation of this modeling framework to other regions and other wildlife disease systems.•The two agent-based models, {MOOvPOP} and {MOOvPOPsurveillance}, incorporate real-world heterogeneities underpinned by host characteristics, disease spread dynamics, and sampling biases in hunter-harvested deer.•The modeling framework facilitates iterative analysis of locally relevant disease surveillance scenarios, thereby facilitating sample size calculations for prompt and reliable detection of important wildlife diseases.•Insights gained from modeling studies can be used to inform the design of effective wildlife disease surveillance strategies. \copyright 2020 The Author(s).

These impacts have ramifications for animals that share resources and across trophic levels. High deer densities result from an absence of predators or high plant productivity, often due to human habitat modifications, and from the desires of stakeholders that set deer management goals based on cultural, rather than biological, carrying capacity. Success at maintaining forest ecosystems require regulating deer below biological carrying capacity, as measured by ecological impacts. Control methods limit reproduction through modifications in habitat productivity or increase mortality through increasing predators or hunting. Hunting is the primary deer management tool and relies on active participation of citizens. Hunters are capable of reducing deer densities but struggle with creating densities sufficiently low to ensure the persistence of rare species. Alternative management models may be necessary to achieve densities sufficiently below biological carrying capacity. Regardless of the population control adopted, success should be measured by ecological benchmarks and not solely by cultural acceptance. \copyright 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.}

abstract = {Human-wildlife interactions occur where human societies interface with the natural landscape. Some of these interactions can be problematic and lead to negative outcomes, such as the destruction of property or injury to humans or wildlife, especially when they involve large carnivores such as bears. Developing management strategies to mitigate these negative outcomes can be costly, time-consuming, and ethically problematic. We developed an agent-based model of black bears foraging in the forest-urban interface of a small resort community to simulate and test a variety of management strategies. The model allows to quickly and cost-effectively identify those strategies, such as attractant management and deterrence measures, that are most likely to reduce the number of bears that become habituated to human areas and conditioned to anthropogenic food sources. Although increasing the likelihood that a bear is deterred from human areas did have some effect, model outcomes indicated that the elimination of sources of anthropogenic food was the more effective management strategy. However, the model also revealed that interactions between the spatial configurations of these two approaches impacted the overall effectiveness of each. Notably, the random distribution of an increase in deterrence across the area of interest in conjunction with a focus on attractant removal around the perimeter of said area was the most effective spatial implementation of the two strategies together. This result provides a quantitative confirmation that reducing anthropogenic food availability should be the highest priority for managers seeking to reduce the number of conflict bears in urban areas, but also that the spatial configuration of any applied strategies is important to consider. The agent-based modelling approach proved a fast and cost-effective way to compare a variety of possible management strategies and the different ways in which they can be arranged in a specific landscape.}

abstract = {Camera traps are heat- or motion-activated cameras placed in the wild to monitor and investigate animal populations and behavior. They are used to locate threatened species, identify important habitats, monitor sites of interest, and analyze wildlife activity patterns. At present, the time required to manually review images severely limits productivity. Additionally, \~70\% of camera trap images are empty, due to a high rate of false triggers. Previous work has shown good results on automated species classification in camera trap data (Norouzzadeh et al. 2018), but further analysis has shown that these results do not generalize to new cameras or new geographic regions (Beery et al. 2018). Additionally, these models will fail to recognize any species they were not trained on. In theory, it is possible to re-train an existing model in order to add missing species, but in practice, this is quite difficult and requires just as much machine learning expertise as training models from scratch. Consequently, very few organizations have successfully deployed machine learning tools for accelerating camera trap image annotation. We propose a different approach to applying machine learning to camera trap projects, combining a generalizable detector with project-specific classifiers . We have trained an animal detector that is able to find and localize (but not identify) animals, even species not seen during training, in diverse ecosystems worldwide. See Fig. 1 for examples of the detector run over camera trap data covering a diverse set of regions and species, unseen at training time. By first finding and localizing animals, we are able to: drastically reduce the time spent filtering empty images, and dramatically simplify the process of training species classifiers, because we can crop images to individual animals (and thus classifiers need only worry about animal pixels, not background pixels). drastically reduce the time spent filtering empty images, and dramatically simplify the process of training species classifiers, because we can crop images to individual animals (and thus classifiers need only worry about animal pixels, not background pixels). With this detector model as a powerful new tool, we have established a modular pipeline for on-boarding new organizations and building project-specific image processing systems. We break our pipeline into four stages: 1. Data ingestion First we transfer images to the cloud, either by uploading to a drop point or by mailing an external hard drive. Data comes in a variety of formats; we convert each data set to the {COCO}-Camera Traps format, i.e. we create a Javascript Object Notation ({JSON}) file that encodes the annotations and the image locations within the organization\textquoterights file structure. 2. Animal detection We next run our (generic) animal detector on all the images to locate animals. We have developed an infrastructure for efficiently running this detector on millions of images, dividing the load over multiple nodes. We find that a single detector works for a broad range of regions and species. If the detection results (as validated by the organization) are not sufficiently accurate, it is possible to collect annotations for a small set of their images and fine-tune the detector. Typically these annotations would be fed back into a new version of the general detector, improving results for subsequent projects. 3. Species classification Using species labels provided by the organization, we train a (project-specific) classifier on the cropped-out animals. 4. Applying the system to new data We use the general detector and the project-specific classifier to power tools facilitating accelerated verification and image review, e.g. visualizing the detections, selecting images for review based on model confidence, etc. The aim of this presentation is to present a new approach to structuring camera trap projects, and to formalize discussion around the steps that are required to successfully apply machine learning to camera trap images.

abstract = {We introduce Pathfinder, a variational method for approximately sampling from differentiable log densities. Starting from a random initialization, Pathfinder locates normal approximations to the target density along a quasi-Newton optimization path, with local covariance estimated using the inverse Hessian estimates produced by the optimizer. Pathfinder returns draws from the approximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler ({KL}) divergence to the true posterior. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior distributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those from automatic differentiation variational inference ({ADVI}) and comparable to those produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({HMC}), as measured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to {ADVI} and short dynamic {HMC} runs, Pathfinder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and gradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors. Importance resampling over multiple runs of Pathfinder improves the diversity of approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a measure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or in minor modes. The Monte Carlo {KL}-divergence estimates are embarrassingly parallelizable in the core Pathfinder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the resampling version, further increasing Pathfinder's speed advantage with multiple cores.}

abstract = {High-resolution monitoring is fundamental to understand ecosystems dynamics in an era of global change and biodiversity declines. While real-time and automated monitoring of abiotic components has been possible for some time, monitoring biotic components-for example, individual behaviours and traits, and species abundance and distribution-is far more challenging. Recent technological advancements offer potential solutions to achieve this through: (i) increasingly affordable high-throughput recording hardware, which can collect rich multidimensional data, and (ii) increasingly accessible artificial intelligence approaches, which can extract ecological knowledge from large datasets. However, automating the monitoring of facets of ecological communities via such technologies has primarily been achieved at low spatiotemporal resolutions within limited steps of the monitoring workflow. Here, we review existing technologies for data recording and processing that enable automated monitoring of ecological communities. We then present novel frameworks that combine such technologies, forming fully automated pipelines to detect, track, classify and count multiple species, and record behavioural and morphological traits, at resolutions which have previously been impossible to achieve. Based on these rapidly developing technologies, we illustrate a solution to one of the greatest challenges in ecology: the ability to rapidly generate high-resolution, multidimensional and standardised data across complex ecologies. \copyright 2022 The Authors.

abstract = {Continuing geographic spread of chronic wasting disease ({CWD}) poses a serious threat to the sustainable future of cervids and hunting in North America. Moreover, {CWD} has been detected in captive cervids in South Korea and, in recent years, in free-ranging reindeer in Europe (Norway). Management of this disease is limited by logistical, financial, and sociopolitical considerations, and current strategies primarily focus on reducing host densities through hunter harvest and targeted culling. The success of such strategies in mitigating the spread and prevalence of {CWD} only upon detection is questionable. Here, we propose a proactive approach that emphasizes pre-emptive management through purposeful integration of virtual experiments (simulating alternate interventions as model scenarios) with the aim of evaluating their effectiveness. Here, we have used a published agent-based model that links white-tailed deer demography and behavior with {CWD} transmission dynamics to first derive a {CWD} outbreak trajectory and then use the trajectory to highlight issues associated with different phases of the {CWD} outbreak (pre-establishment/transition/endemic). Specifically, we highlight the practical constraints on surveillance in the pre-establishment phase and recommend that agencies use a realistic detection threshold for their {CWD} surveillance programs. We further demonstrate that many disease introductions are "dead ends" not leading to a full epidemic due to high stochasticity and harvesting in the pre-establishment phase of {CWD}. Model evaluated pre-emptive (pre-detection) harvest strategies could increase the resilience of the deer population to {CWD} spread and establishment. We conclude it is important to adaptively position {CWD} management ahead of, rather than behind, the {CWD} front.

abstract = {The intensive harvesting of hosts is often the only practicable strategy for controlling emerging wildlife diseases. Several harvesting approaches have been explored theoretically with the objective of lowering transmission rates, decreasing the transmission period or specifically targeting spatial disease clusters or high-risk demographic groups. Here, we present a novel model-based approach to evaluate alternative harvest regimes, in terms of demographic composition and rates, intended to increase the probability to remove all infected individuals in the population during the early phase of an outbreak. We tested the utility of the method for the elimination of chronic wasting disease based on empirical data for reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Norway, in populations with (Nordfjella) and without (Hardangervidda) knowledge about exact disease prevalence and population abundance. Low and medium harvest intensities were unsuccessful in eliminating the disease, even at low prevalence. High-intensity harvesting had a high likelihood of eliminating the disease, but probability was strongly influenced by the disease prevalence. We suggest that the uncertainty about disease prevalence can be mitigated by using an adaptive management approach: forecast from models after each harvest season with updated data, derive prevalence estimates and forecast further harvesting. We identified the problems arising from disease surveillance with large fluctuations in harvesting pressure and hence sample sizes. The elimination method may be suitable for pathogens that cause long-lasting infections and with slow epidemic growth, but the method should only be attempted if there is a low risk of reinfection, either by a new disease introduction event (e.g. dispersing hosts) or due to environmental reservoirs. Our simulations highlighted the short time window when such a strategy is likely to be successful before approaching near complete eradication of the population. \copyright 2021 The Authors.}

Estimates can then be used to develop a harvest strategy to guide decision‐making. Mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ) are an important species in the Atlantic Flyway for many users and they exhibited exponential growth in the eastern United States between the 1970s and 1990s. Since then, estimates of mallard abundance have declined 16\%, prompting the Atlantic Flyway Council and United States Fish and Wildlife Service to implement more restrictive hunting regulations and develop a new harvest strategy predicated on an updated population model. Our primary objective was to develop an integrated population model ({IPM}) for use in an eastern mallard harvest management strategy. We developed an {IPM} using annual estimates of breeding abundance, 2‐season banding and recovery data, and hunter‐harvest data from 1998 to 2018. When developing the model, we used novel model selection methods to test various forms of a sub‐model for survival including estimating the degree of harvest additivity and any age‐specific trends. The top survival sub‐model included a negative annual trend on juvenile survival. The {IPM} posterior estimates for population abundance tracked closely with the observed estimates and estimates of mean annual population growth rate ranged from 0.88 to 1.08. Our population model provided increased precision in abundance estimates compared to survey methods for use in an updated harvest strategy. The {IPM} posterior estimates of survival rates were relatively stable for adult cohorts, and annual growth rate was positively correlated with the female age ratio, a measure of reproduction. Either or both of those demographic parameters, juvenile survival or reproduction, could be a target for management efforts to address the population decline. The resulting demographic parameters provided information on the equilibrium population size and can be used in an adaptive harvest strategy for mallards in eastern North America.}

Yet, understanding of species distributions remains patchy. Biodiversity data from social media can potentially reduce the global biodiversity knowledge gap.

Following data privacy and protection safeguards, we devised a standardized method for extracting species distribution records from Facebook groups that allow access to their data. It involves 3 steps: group selection, data extraction, and georeferencing the record location. We present how to structure keywords, search for species photographs, and georeference localities for such records. We further highlight some challenges users might face when extracting species distribution data from Facebook and suggest solutions. Following our proposed framework, we present a case study on Bangladesh's biodiversity-a tropical megadiverse South Asian country. We scraped nearly 45,000 unique georeferenced records across 967 species and found a median of 27 records per species. About 12\% of the distribution data were for threatened species, representing 27\% of all species. We also obtained data for 56 {DataDeficient} species for Bangladesh.

We employ a Bayesian hierarchical framework to borrow information from harvest data on related species to overcome issues due to the lack of hunting management information. We conducted a simulation study to explore model performance and parameter identifiability under different scenarios (sample size, species catchability/abundance and unmodelled heterogeneity) and assessed the method on a real case study with four species in central Spain. The simulation study confirmed that with a large enough sample size ( n  \textgreater 5000), high catchability and lack of unmodelled heterogeneity in the abundance process, the model was able to obtain unbiased estimations for total abundance parameters. In the case study, our model successfully captured species‐habitat relationships and produced reliable estimates of total abundance at regional scale. Internal validation with independent test data and external validation with fieldwork data confirmed the model's ability to predict hunting yields and estimate species total abundance accurately. Our approach provides a flexible and valuable tool for large‐scale monitoring programs relying on harvest data with potential applications in wildlife management and conservation. However, the method should be applied with caution when there is unmodelled heterogeneity, low catchability or the sample size is small (\textless5000).}

This study used a quantitative content analysis to assess the most common and engaging elements of wildlife images posted to Instagram in 2020 and 2021, using Australian conservation organisations as a case study. A total of 670 wildlife images from the Instagram accounts of 160 conservation organisation Instagram accounts were coded and analysed. Results highlight that the most common image elements used included natural backgrounds, mammals and birds, and no human presence. In addition, it was found that the taxon of the animal featured in a post and the presence of humans did not impact engagement levels.

Other fields have developed causal inference approaches that can enhance and expand our ability to answer ecological causal questions using observational or experimental data. However, the lack of comprehensive resources applying causal inference to ecological settings and jargon from multiple disciplines creates barriers. We introduce approaches for causal inference, discussing the main frameworks for counterfactual causal inference, how causal inference differs from other research aims and key challenges; the application of causal inference in experimental and quasi-experimental study designs; appropriate interpretation of the results of causal inference approaches given their assumptions and biases; foundational papers; and the data requirements and trade-offs between internal and external validity posed by different designs. We highlight that these designs generally prioritise internal validity over generalisability. Finally, we identify opportunities and considerations for ecologists to further integrate causal inference with synthesis science and meta-analysis and expand the spatiotemporal scales at which causal inference is possible. We advocate for ecology as a field to collectively define best practices for causal inference. \copyright 2025 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.}

abstract = {Recreational hunting has been the dominant game management and conservation mechanism in the United States for the past century. However, there are numerous modern-day issues that reduce the viability and efficacy of hunting-based management, such as fewer hunters, overabundant wildlife populations, limited access, and emerging infectious diseases in wildlife. Quantifying the drivers of recreational harvest by hunters could inform potential management actions to address these issues, but this is seldom comprehensively accomplished because data collection practices limit some analytical applications (e.g., differing spatial scales of harvest regulations and harvest data). Additionally, managing large-scale issues, such as infectious diseases, requires collaborations across management agencies, which is challenging or impossible if data are not standardized. Here we discuss modern issues with the prevailing wildlife management framework in the United States from an analytical point of view with a case study of white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) in the Midwest. We have four aims: (1) describe the interrelated processes that comprise hunting and suggest improvements to current data collections systems, (2) summarize data collection systems employed by state wildlife management agencies in the Midwestern United States and discuss potential for large-scale data standardization, (3) assess how aims 1 and 2 influence managing infectious diseases in hunted wildlife, and (4) suggest actionable steps to help guide data collection standards and management practices. To achieve these goals, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources disseminated a questionnaire to state wildlife agencies (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin), and we report and compare their harvest management structures, data collection practices, and responses to chronic wasting disease. We hope our \textquotedblleftcall to action\textquotedblright encourages re-evaluation, coordination, and improvement of harvest and management data collection practices with the goal of improving the analytical potential of these data. A deeper understanding of the strengths and deficiencies of our current management systems in relation to harvest and management data collection methods could benefit the future development of comprehensive and collaborative management and research initiatives (e.g., adaptive management) for wildlife and their diseases.}

Despite being the most widely available class of biodiversity data, opportunistically collected records have remained largely inaccessible to community ecologists since the imperfect and highly heterogeneous detection process can severely bias inference. We present a novel statistical approach that leverages these datasets by embedding a spatiotemporal joint species distribution model within a flexible site-occupancy framework. Our model addresses variable detection probabilities across visits and species by modelling phenological patterns and by extending the use of latent variables to characterise observer-specific detection and reporting behaviour. We apply our model to an opportunistically collected dataset on lentic odonates, encompassing over 100,000 waterbody visits in Flanders (N-Belgium), to show that the model provides insights into biological communities at high resolution, including phenology, interannual trends, environmental associations and spatiotemporal co-distributional patterns in community composition. \copyright 2025 The Author(s).

abstract = {Harvested wildlife populations should ideally be monitored to inform harvest policies and decision‐making to help achieve management objectives. When the age of harvested individuals can be obtained, these data (i.e., age‐at‐harvest data) can be used to estimate trends of abundances, demographic rates, and harvest probabilities by the statistical reconstruction of the living population. This approach was developed primarily within the frequentist framework and requires the inclusion of auxiliary data (e.g., radiotelemetry data). We developed a novel Bayesian hierarchical approach allowing the population reconstruction from the definition of the species' life cycle without auxiliary data. The hierarchical model assumes that individuals are harvested from an open population whose fluctuations result from demographic processes, and the definition of a superpopulation composed of pseudo‐individuals from which the harvested population is drawn. We evaluated the ability of our model to estimate abundances, survival, recruitment, and harvest probabilities based on simulations guided by the demographic processes of a long‐lived mammal population. We considered model performance across scenarios, including varying age and temporal structures, superpopulation size, and prior information. We showed how prior information selected based on life history characteristics affects the accuracy of estimated parameters. We found that the model estimates accurate demographic parameters and abundances when the age‐at‐harvest matrix comprises more than two age classes. Furthermore, an increase in demographic information (number of age groups and years) increased the precision of the estimated parameters. We apply our model to a population of harvested (2012–2021) white‐tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) and a mammalian carnivore, the fisher ( Pekania pennanti ), from Rhode Island, {USA}. Our model estimated biologically realistic population size and demographic rates for both species. Our approach provides robustness to track the population abundance of harvested species through time and estimate fundamental demographic parameters. Such results can be used to monitor whether population objectives are being met and whether harvest policy changes are required. Furthermore, this information can be critical for evaluating the effect of harvest on population growth and projecting trajectories of age‐structured populations under different harvest scenarios. Therefore, our framework can help to guide management decisions and species conservation.}

abstract = {{ABSTRACT}  The coyote ( Canis latrans ) is a recent addition to the fauna of eastern North America, and in many areas coyote populations have been established for only a decade or two. Although coyotes are known predators of white‐tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) in their historic range, effects this new predator may have on eastern deer populations have received little attention. We speculated that in the southeastern United States, coyotes may be affecting deer recruitment, and we present 5 lines of evidence that suggest this possibility. First, the statewide deer population in South Carolina has declined coincident with the establishment and increase in the coyote population. Second, data sets from the Savannah River Site ({SRS}) in South Carolina indicate a new mortality source affecting the deer population concurrent with the increase in coyotes. Third, an index of deer recruitment at {SRS} declined during the period of increase in coyotes. Fourth, food habits data from {SRS} indicate that fawns are an important food item for coyotes during summer. Finally, recent research from Alabama documented significant coyote predation on fawns there. Although this evidence does not establish cause and effect between coyotes and observed declines in deer recruitment, we argue that additional research should proactively address this topic in the region. We identified several important questions on the nature of the deer\textemdashcoyote relationship in the East.}

We digitized maps from 1950, 1970, 1982, and 2003 and reviewed literature to quantify population sizes and densities in the Southeast, although previous estimates may not be accurate. Deer population sizes declined to a minimum of \textless215,000 during the early 1900s. Population sizes and mean deer densities were 304,000 and 0.22 deer/km 2 by 1940, 476,000 and 0.35 deer/km 2 by 1950, 2.9 million to 4.1 million and 2.2 to 3.1 deer/km 2 by approximately 1970, 6.2 million and 4.6 deer/km 2 by 1982, and 10.8 million to 12 million and 8 to 9 deer/km 2 by about 2003. Although our estimates are likely not completely accurate in space and time, due to difficulty of counting animals, they provide the best available information and a range and trend in values, with general corroboration among sources. The current population size may be greater than during pre‐Euro‐American settlement, when based on minimum historical deer densities, or, conversely, the current population may be within the bounds of mid to high historical deer densities. Large deer densities trigger a research need to evaluate deer effects on vegetation, but threshold densities when deer are damaging to herbaceous plants may need to be reconsidered. Instead, we conjecture that deer may be considered a natural disturbance helpful in controlling increased tree densities during the past century, albeit placing a secondary stress upon declining herbaceous plants, which are losing ground to trees. \copyright 2020 The Wildlife Society.}

abstract = {Although generally abundant, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations in the southeastern United States have recently experienced several localized declines attributed to reduced fawn recruitment following the establishment of coyotes (Canis latrans). The Southern Appalachians is a mountainous region suggested to be experiencing white-tailed deer declines, as harvest numbers and hunter success rates have substantially decreased in northern Georgia since 1979. Low fawn survival (16\%) was also recently documented in the Chattahoochee National Forest ({CNF}) in northern Georgia, necessitating further examination. We radio-collared 14 yearling and 45 adult female white-tailed deer along with 71 fawns during 2018-2020 in the {CNF} to estimate field-based vital rates (i.e., survival and fecundity) and parameterize stage-structured population models. We projected population growth rates (\lambda) over 10 years to evaluate the current rate of decline and various other management scenarios. Our results indicated that the observed population would decline by an average of 4.0\% annually (\lambda = 0.960) under current conditions. Only scenarios including antlerless harvest restrictions in addition to improved fawn survival resulted in positive growth (\lambda = 1.019, 1.085), suggesting these measures are likely necessary for population recovery in the region. This approach can be applied by wildlife managers to inform site-specific management strategies.}

abstract = {Since the early 1980s, Quality Deer Management ({QDM}) has been used widely to manage populations of white‐tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) in the United States. Since 2000, {QDM} has been a catalyst behind a suite of deer management cooperatives ({DMCs}) forming across the United States. Although {QDM} has grown in popularity among North American deer hunters, large‐scale implementation of multi‐landowner {DMCs} relies on voluntary changes to implement structured hunter harvest behavior to achieve management goals. Therefore, a national review of how {DMCs} influence harvest behavior of hunters and if the {DMC} model works to accomplish deer management goals is warranted. We assessed if {DMCs} change the harvest behavior of their members, and if factors such as state, motivations, and length of membership influence change in hunter behavior. Results from our survey of 459 {DMC} members across 5 U.S. states found that {DMC} members' harvest behavior changed after joining their {DMC}. Deer management cooperative members reported they were more likely to harvest does, less likely to harvest yearling males, and more likely to pass on the harvest of a 3.5 year old (or younger) males after joining the {DMC}. When analyzed at the state level, Texas and Georgia saw the largest gains in perceived hunt quality (2.5 point gain on 1–7 scale) and {QDM} implementation. Motivations for joining the {DMC} had little impact, but length of membership influenced hunt behavior with more tenured members (\textgreater5 years of membership) being more likely to follow {QDM} practices. Our results suggest that {DMCs} serve stakeholders by increasing perceived hunt quality, assisting agency personnel with non‐regulatory avenues to address management goals, and developing a community engaged with local wildlife management. Deer management cooperatives occupy the critical nexus of agency needs and private landowner deer management objectives, often at scales larger than a single private landowner, that are necessary for effectively managing wild deer populations. Although {DMCs} may not be widely implemented, they may address a myriad of management objectives that public and private stakeholders desire.}

However, differences in deer survival between public and private lands can exist and, if unaccounted for, may affect wildlife agencies' ability to effectively manage statewide and local deer populations. From 2014 to 2016, we radiocollared and monitored survival of 79 adult white‐tailed deer (141 deer‐years; 62 male, 79 female) on 2 public and 2 private properties in Alabama, {USA}. We assessed the effects of sex, age, and landownership type (i.e., public or private) on adult white‐tailed deer harvest and survival patterns using an information‐theoretic approach. Hunter harvest accounted for 77\% of observed mortalities ( n  = 23/30), but harvest and survival rates varied by sex and age. Harvest and survival were similar between public and private property despite more restrictive hunting regulations for antlered deer on public areas. Similar harvest rates were likely due to self‐imposed, quality deer management ({QDM}) harvest strategies on private land that emulated the effects of a state‐mandated antler point restriction ({APR}) on public land. Our findings indicate survival rates of adult white‐tailed deer may be applicable across landownership types where state‐mandated harvest regulations with respect to males are more restrictive on public than private property, due to the popularity of {QDM} by private‐land deer hunters. However, where regulations are similar across landownership types (e.g., no state‐mandated {APR}), differences in harvest and survival rates may exist.}

The {PAD}-{US} is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all open space public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, permanent and long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. 'Wilderness Area'), Executive (e.g. 'National Monument'), and administrative designations (e.g. 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern') documented in agency management plans are also included. The {PAD}-{US} strives to be a complete inventory of U.S. public land and other protected areas, compiling \textquotedblleftbest available\textquotedblright data provided by managing agencies and organizations.  The {PAD}-{US} geodatabase maps and describes areas using thirty-six attributes and five separate feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation (policy-designated areas), Easement, Marine (protected areas), Proclamation, and Other Planning Boundaries. An additional Combined feature class includes the full {PAD}-{US} inventory to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. The Feature Class ({FeatClass}) field in the Combined layer allows users to extract data types as needed. A Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table facilitates the extraction of authoritative federal data provided or recommended by managing agencies from the Combined {PAD}-{US} inventory. {PAD}-{US} integrates spatial data to ensure public lands and other protected areas from all jurisdictions are represented. {PAD}-{US} version 4 includes a variety of updates to the previous version of the dataset achieving goals to: 1) Regularly update and improve spatial data representing the federal estate for {PAD}-{US} applications; 2) Update state and local lands data as state data-steward and {PAD}-{US} Team resources allow; and 3) Automate data translation efforts to increase {PAD}-{US} update efficiency. {PAD}-{US} 4 includes new and updated data from Federal State and {NGO} data providers.

Neighbourhood interactions between local units are known to contribute to large-scale patterns, but how much do they contribute and what is the role of regional interactions caused by long-distance processes? How much long-distance dispersal do we need to explain the patterns that we observe in nature? There seems to be no way to answer these questions empirically. Therefore, we present a modelling approach that is a combination of a grid-based model describing local interactions and an individual-based model describing dispersal. Applying our approach to the spread of rabies, we show that in addition to local rabies dynamics, one long-distance infection per 14000 km2 per year is sufficient to reproduce the wave-like spread of this disease. We conclude that even rare ecological events that couple local dynamics on a regional scale may have profound impacts on large-scale patterns and, in turn, dynamics. Furthermore, the following results emerge: (i) Both neighbourhood infection and long-distance infection are needed to generate the wave-like dispersal pattern of rabies; (ii) randomly walking rabid foxes are not sufficient to generate the wave pattern; and (iii) on a scale of less than 100 km x 100 km, temporal oscillations emerge that are independent from long-distance dispersal.}

abstract = {Noninvasive data collection methods are increasingly used to monitor endangered, cryptic, or otherwise difficult to observe wildlife populations. Spatial capture‐recapture and count‐based statistical methods are often used to model these data to derive population estimates, each with their own advantages. The goal of our study was to integrate these 2 data sources and model structures to maximize the use of single‐season surveys in which capture‐recapture and count‐based data are collected. We formulated a Bayesian spatial, closed integrated population model ({cIPM}) that leverages scat {DNA}‐based spatial capture‐recapture and camera‐based spatial count sub‐models to derive sex and age class‐specific population estimates. Our {cIPM} has the advantage of sharing the spatial scaling ( \sigma ) parameter directly between sub‐models and drawing proposed individuals from the same data‐augmented superpopulation for each sub‐model. This allows for separate estimation of sex and age‐class groups simultaneously without any assumptions of population structure or conversions between model output types. We applied our {cIPM} to a wild population of Roosevelt elk ( Cervus canadensis roosevelti , Karuk: íshyuux) during winter 2018–2019 in their winter range within Karuk Ancestral Territory in northern California, {USA}. We also conducted a simulation study to test our {cIPM} on a known population consisting of 2 age classes and 2 sexes. The {cIPM} was able to estimate most population, detection, and \sigma parameters with good accuracy, including population size. The assignment of sex and age was biased, however, resulting in fewer juvenile males, more juvenile females, and more adult males. Our {cIPM} applied to the data estimated approximately 310 (95\% {CI} = 235–411) female adults, 90 (95\% {CI} = 57–134) male adults, 75 (95\% {CI} = 43–149) female calves, and 23 (95\% {CI} = 12–47) male calves. These estimates were different from those that would have been made had we relied on common assumptions such as equal calf sex ratios, though this ratio was likely biased towards females based on our simulation results. Our methods are widely applicable and maximize the amount of information available to managers and researchers from any single‐season survey in which separate data sources capturing sex and age‐class information are obtained.}

abstract = {Wildlife biologists increasingly use camera traps for monitoring animal populations. However, manually sifting through the collected images is expensive and time-consuming. Current deep learning studies for camera trap images do not adequately tackle real-world challenges such as imbalances between animal and empty images, distinguishing similar species, and the impact of backgrounds on species identification, limiting the models' applicability in new locations. Here, we present a novel two-stage deep learning framework. First, we train a global deep-learning model using all animal species in the dataset. Then, an agglomerative clustering algorithm groups animals based on their appearance. Subsequently, we train a specialized deep-learning expert model for each animal group to detect similar features. This approach leverages Transfer Learning from the {MegaDetectorV5} ({YOLOv5} version) model, already pre-trained on various animal species and ecosystems. Our two-stage deep learning pipeline uses the global model to redirect images to the appropriate expert models for final classification. We validated this strategy using 1.3 million images from 91 camera traps encompassing 24 mammal species and used 120,000 images for testing, achieving an F1-Score of 96.2\% using expert models for final classification. This method surpasses existing deep learning models, demonstrating improved precision and effectiveness in automated wildlife detection. \copyright 2025. The Author(s).}

abstract = {Occupancy models estimate a species' occupancy probability while accounting for imperfect detection, but often overlook the issue of false-positive detections. This problem of false positives has gained attention recently with the rapid advancement of automated species detection tools using artificial intelligence ({AI}), which generate continuous confidence scores for each species detection. Novel occupancy models have been introduced that integrate these confidence scores to identify false positives, but these models require thorough assessments of diagnosis and validation. Here, we propose a new occupancy model based solely on {AI}-detected species data. We conducted simulations to examine the inferential and predictive accuracies with known true parameters and analyzed {AI}-detected species data to test the practical usefulness through goodness-of-fit tests and evaluation with external data. Our proposed model mostly outperformed alternative models that ignore imperfect detection or false-positive error probabilities in terms of accuracy in simulation analyses and goodness-of-fit tests in the case study, but not in terms of discrimination metrics based on external data. The proposed occupancy model aids in understanding species-habitat relationships and developing automated biodiversity monitoring workflows by accounting for both false-negative and false-positive errors. \copyright 2025 The Author(s).

While forest harvest impacts on wildlife are well-documented, silvicultural treatment effects remain unclear. {OBJECTIVES}: We investigated how forest harvest and silviculture shape predator and ungulate distributions and interactions, providing ecological insights for forest management. {METHODS}: We deployed two camera arrays in extensively harvested North American landscapes to evaluate relationships between forest harvest, silviculture, and predator and ungulate occurrences. {RESULTS}: Forest harvest, silviculture, and predator/prey activity shape wildlife occurrences. Wolf (Canis lupus), influenced by moose (Alces alces), decreased with regenerating (9-24 years) clearcuts, new (0-8 years) clearcuts with reserves, and fertilized cutblocks. Wolves increased with regenerating/older (25-40 years) clearcuts with reserves. Coyote (C. latrans) increased in manually or chemically brushed cutblocks at high or low deer occurrence, respectively. Black bear (U. americanus), influenced by prey, increased with regenerating prepared cutblocks and fewer new prepared cutblocks. Prey elevated lynx (Lynx canadensis) occurrence with regenerating prepared or older unprepared cutblocks. Depending on predators, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) decreased with regenerating and older prepared cutblocks; white-tailed deer (O. virginianus) decreased with selection- and new even-aged cutblocks. Harvest age and wolves best explained moose, although silviculture mattered seasonally. {CONCLUSIONS}: Silviculture shapes wildlife distributions and interactions. Integrating these effects into research and forest management is essential for meeting ecological objectives. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10980-025-02095-z. \copyright The Author(s) 2025.}

However, on-the-ground action is hindered by context dependency: the ubiquitous challenge that implementation outcomes vary from place to place due to complex dependencies among social and ecological drivers. Policymakers and practitioners recognize the need to tailor solutions to contexts, and target actions to places where they will work effectively. To provide information for decision-making, applied ecologists can learn from medicine and marketing, which aim to provide healthcare tailored to individual patients, and advertisements targeting individual tastes. These disciplines exploit big data and rapidly developing computational advances to predict treatment effects for individual units. Here we argue why and how ecological disciplines can begin to capitalize on these rich advances, to equip ecologists with a potentially powerful toolkit for applying big data to site-specific interventions, allowing effective conservation over large extents. We review approaches that hold promise for applied ecology, identify hurdles that must be overcome and propose a roadmap for establishing the conditions that will permit adoption of precision ecology. \copyright 2025.

Data integration can provide comprehensive inferences while improving accuracy, precision, and scope but faces challenges in modeling misaligned resolutions and observational uncertainties. We developed a multi-scale, integrated species distribution model ({MS}-{iSDM}) for North American bats to combine data across monitoring types and seasons using joint likelihood methods, observational models with false-negatives and false-positives, and seasonal migratory connectivity. We applied this model to 11 years of data for an imperiled bat species (tricolored bat, Perimyotis subflavus). Relative abundance and occupancy were linked with multi-scale predictors, revealing clear patterns of population declines, but with important differences in spatial trends (abundance: corresponded with white-nose syndrome impacts, occupancy: at the range periphery) and overall severity (abundance: -74.8\%, 95\% {CRI}: -79.7\% to -69.3\%; occupancy: -35.5\%, 95\% {CRI}: -41.1\% to -30.2\%). The asynchrony between occupancy trends and population impacts was explained as an emergent pattern of spatiotemporal variation in abundance in the integrated distribution model. Compared to multiple lines of evidence, the integrated model provided consensus-estimates, increased precision and spatiotemporal scope, and strengthened evidence of population declines. \copyright 2025.

abstract = {Occupancy models estimate distributions of imperfectly detected species, but violations of the closure assumption can bias results. However, researchers working with mobile animals may find it impossible to eliminate such violations. Here, we tested the hypothesis that occupancy models fit to realistic sampling data can generate unbiased occupancy estimates for an itinerant Wood Thrush ( Hylocichla mustelina ) population. In 2013 and 2014, we tracked movements of 41 breeding Wood Thrush males. We modelled territory shift probabilities using logistic exposure models and within‐territory movements using continuous‐time stochastic process models. We then constructed an individual‐based model, simulated (1000 iterations) spatiotemporal locations for individuals and simulated sampling these populations using 162 different point count protocols with variable spatial (sampling radius and point placement method), and temporal (survey length, between‐survey intervals and number of surveys) characteristics. We compared occupancy estimates with true values of instantaneous, daily and seasonal occupancy from the simulations. We parameterized continuous time stochastic process models based on movements within 34 unique territories and estimated a daily territory shift probability of 0.0099 (95\% {CI}: 0.0060, 0.0152). Simulated data indicated that estimates of occupancy ranged from 0.18 (0.06, 1.00) to 0.80 (0.71, 0.89) depending on protocol characteristics. Occupancy estimates increased with increasing survey radius, survey length and between‐survey interval. Protocols using shorter surveys and between‐survey intervals were good estimators for instantaneous occupancy (low bias and mean‐squared error) but poor estimators for daily and seasonal occupancy; longer surveys and intervals generated unbiased estimators of daily occupancy but underestimated seasonal occupancy. Logistic regression models that ignored imperfect detection outperformed occupancy models for estimating instantaneous occupancy but not daily or seasonal occupancy. For mobile animals, occupancy of sampling sites changes in space and time. Consequently, the spatial and temporal aspects of a sampling protocol have strong, but predictable, effects on occupancy model parameter estimates. Our results demonstrate that how these factors interact is critical for designing surveys that produce occupancy estimates representative of the biological process of interest to a researcher.}

abstract = {Management of harvested populations relies on accurate assessment of abundance within management units to reevaluate and set harvest regulations. Several statistical approaches use readily available age-at-harvest data to estimate populations, but these often rely on auxiliary data which can be costly to collect and may not provide reliable estimates at the management unit scale. We developed a Bayesian integrated population model ({IPM}) relying solely on available harvest data to estimate abundance of white-tailed deer in Tennessee where estimates of abundance were lacking. We fit the {IPM} to reported harvest data and estimates of total harvest from hunter surveys to estimate abundance statewide and within deer management units ({DMUs}). Statewide deer harvest in Tennessee from 2005 to 2023 ranged between 132,256 and 181,477 deer annually (mean = 160,050; {SD} = 16,178). Although the population fluctuated, median population growth rate was 0.99 (90\% {CRI} 0.978-1.003) during the study. Statewide population abundance was estimated at 890,657 (90\% {CRI} 786,627-1,172,514) deer in 2023. Our {IPM} provided a comprehensive picture of deer population dynamics and allowed us to estimate abundance and demographic rates using only harvest data and informative priors. This model demonstrates the benefits of using informative priors and regularizing parameters in ecological studies. The {IPM} is a useful, flexible tool to monitor harvested populations at finer spatial scales thereby allowing decisions on harvest regulations to be based on precise estimates of abundance within specific management units.

abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: The robust estimation of local extinction risk is central to inform management and conservation efforts. Still, estimating this key demographic parameter requires standardized monitoring data that are lacking for most species and systems. The analysis of community science data is emerging as a promising alternative. These expansive datasets leverage observations from multiple volunteers that provide higher temporal and spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the proper analysis of community science data is challenging because it requires accounting for additional complexities in the intrinsic ecological and observational processes. To address this issue, we describe and test a quantitative approach that fits continuous state-space models iteratively to {eBird} data with the ultimate goal of estimating local persistence probability through time. We evaluated model accuracy by comparing estimates and trends from {eBird} with those from the endangered Everglades\textquoteright snail kite long-term, standardized monitoring project. We also performed two separate sensitivity analyses (temporal and sampling thinning) to assess how robust the persistence estimates are to a reduction in the number of {eBird} observations available. Our results showed that the temporal trend trajectory of local population persistence estimated from {eBird} closely matched that from standardized monitoring. Moreover, the trend remained similar even when reducing the amount of {eBird} data available to 5\% of the original data set – a reduction from 258 to 13 weeks or from 7,714 to 385 lists of observations across 5 years of monitoring. {SYNTHESIS} {AND} {APPLICATIONS}: Our modeling framework provides a robust, computationally efficient, and easy-to-apply tool for monitoring local persistence probability that can support global conservation efforts. This will complement the monitoring of species population viability in places where standardized monitoring is still lacking, but community science observations are common.}

abstract = {Although the use of camera traps in wildlife management is well established, technologies to automate image processing have been much slower in development, despite their potential to drastically reduce personnel time and cost required to review photos. We developed {AnimalFinder} in {MATLAB\textregistered} to identify animal presence in time-lapse camera trap images by comparing individual photos to all images contained within the subset of images (i.e. photos from the same survey and site), with some manual processing required to remove false positives and collect other relevant data (species, sex, etc.). We tested {AnimalFinder} on a set of camera trap images and compared the presence/absence results with manual-only review with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), wild pigs (Sus scrofa), and raccoons (Procyon lotor). We compared abundance estimates, model rankings, and coefficient estimates of detection and abundance for white-tailed deer using N-mixture models. {AnimalFinder} performance varied depending on a threshold value that affects program sensitivity to frequently occurring pixels in a series of images. Higher threshold values led to fewer false negatives (missed deer images) but increased manual processing time, but even at the highest threshold value, the program reduced the images requiring manual review by \~ 40\% and correctly identified \textgreater 90\% of deer, raccoon, and wild pig images. Estimates of white-tailed deer were similar between {AnimalFinder} and the manual-only method (\~ 1–2 deer difference, depending on the model), as were model rankings and coefficient estimates. Our results show that the program significantly reduced data processing time and may increase efficiency of camera trapping surveys.}

abstract = {Economic losses due to infection with Bovine viral diarrhea virus ({BVDV}) have prompted introduction of organized control programs. These programs primarily focus on the removal of persistently infected ({PI}) animals, the main source of {BVDV} transmission. Recently, persistent {BVDV} infection was demonstrated experimentally in white-tailed deer, the most abundant wild ruminant in North America. Contact of cattle and white-tailed deer may result in interspecific {BVDV} transmission and birth of persistently infected offspring that could be a threat to control programs. The objective of this study was to assess the potential for interspecific {BVDV} transmission from persistently infected cattle cohabitated with pregnant white-tailed deer. Seven female and one male white-tailed deer were captured and bred in captivity. At approximately 50 days of gestation, two cattle persistently infected with {BVDV} 1 were cohabitated with the deer. In a pen of approximately 0.8 ha, both species shared food and water sources for a period of 60 days. Transmission of {BVDV} as indicated by seroconversion was demonstrated in all exposed adult deer. Of the seven pregnancies, four resulted in offspring that were infected with {BVDV}. Persistent infection was demonstrated in three singlet fawns by immunohistochemistry and {ELISA} on skin samples, {PCR}, and virus isolation procedures. Furthermore, two stillborn fetuses were apparently persistently infected. This is the first report of {BVDV} transmission from cattle to white-tailed deer using a model of natural challenge. Under appropriate circumstances, {BVDV} may efficiently cross the species barrier to cause transplacental infection and persistently infected offspring in a wildlife species.}

Spotlight counts are widely used to index deer abundance; however, detection probabilities using spotlights have not been formally estimated. Using a closed mark\textemdashrecapture design, we explored the efficiency of spotlights for detecting deer by operating thermal imagers and spotlights simultaneously. Spotlights detected only 50.6\% of the deer detected by thermal imagers. Relative to the thermal imager, spotlights failed to detect 44.2\% of deer groups (≥1 deer). Detection probabilities for spotlight observers varied between and within observers, ranging from 0.30 ({SE} = 0.053) to 0.66 ({SE} = 0.058). Managers commonly assume that although road counts based on convenience sampling designs are imperfect, observers can gather population‐trend information from repeated counts along the same survey route. Our results indicate detection rate varied between and within observers and surveyed transects. If detection probabilities are substantially affected by many variables, and if transect selection is not based on appropriate sampling designs, it may be impractical to correct road spotlight counts for detection probabilities to garner unbiased estimates of population size.}

abstract = {Since Trivers and Willard first proposed their hypothesis concerning the adaptive advantages of producing a particular offspring sex in relation to maternal condition in 1973, it has been at the forefront of scientific research concerning sex ratios with most subsequent studies focusing on maternal condition as a key contributor to variations in sex ratios. Another factor that could greatly influence sex ratios, although has been only infrequently examined in mammalian species, is birth date. We investigated how birth date influenced offspring sex ratios in White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Since date of birth can greatly influence an individual\textquoterights fitness and reproductive success, we suggest that birth date may be an alternative strategy in determining offspring sex ratios. Since it has been shown that the lifetime reproductive fitness of a mother can be increased by producing a particular sex during a particular time, we hypothesized that more male offspring should be born earlier in the season due to their increased reproductive potential from being born at this time. Offspring born earlier will have a head start in development and therefore have greater potential for increased body size and dominance later in life, traits that greatly influence male reproductive success. In this study, we found that maternal condition did not affect offspring sex ratio in a captive population of White-tailed Deer in Michigan; however, birth date did. We found that more males tended to be born during the second and fourth birthing periods, while more females were born during the first, third and fifth periods. In addition, we found that males born earlier in the season had greater mass the following spring than those born later, a trend that was not as dramatic in females. These results lend moderate support to our hypothesis that in White-tailed Deer offspring sex will tend to vary according to timing of birth and relative reproductive advantages gained by a particular sex being born at that time.}

abstract = {Using current methods of age determination, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from the same cohort are classified as 1.5-year-old deer when actual age may vary by 6 or more months. We measured mandibular tooth row length (mm) on mandible impressions of 41 (23 males and 18 females) known-age captive white-tailed deer to develop an aging model that would estimate age in days. To test the model, each month from 12 to 24 months, we measured dentitions of 34 (19 males, 15 females) known-age captive white-tailed deer. We found that mandibular tooth row length was a strong predictor of age for both males (r2=0.93; P ≤ 0.0001) and females (r2=0.92; P ≤ 0.0001). For males and females, respectively, the equations that predicted age (days) were In (age) = -4.34 + 2.45 In (mandibular tooth row length in mm) and In (age) = -4.62 + 2.54 In (mandibular tooth row length in mm). The models predicted \textgreater50\% of test jaws for males from 14 to 24 months and \textgreater60\% of test jaws for females from 16-24 months within 7 days of actual age. Peak accuracy occurred at 18 months for males and 19-21 months of age for females. These models complement current aging methods and could be used by wildlife biologists in the field to age hunter-harvested deer ≤24 months.}

abstract = {Agent-based systems are an important application area of artificial intelligence and are used in decision support systems. Rather than being a problem-solving tool, agent-based system is a tool for developing and testing alternative solutions according to various scenarios. In this context, agent-based modeling is a very effective method to support decision makers in emergency situations to evaluate different risk scenarios and then make decisions quickly and effectively. Moreover, agent-based modeling is a very useful method to support decision makers in situations of high complexity and uncertainty. The aim of this study is to review state-of-the-art research and give researchers insights into how to use agent-based modeling while developing decision support systems. This paper introduces current studies performed with several agent-based modeling toolkits and software environments such as {NetLogo}, {AnyLogic}, {MATSim} and Repast. In this paper, after giving a brief definition of an agent-based system and explaining the importance of concepts such as emergence and complexity in the field of agent-based modeling, it is explained who uses the agent-based models for what purpose, when, where, why and how to use agent-based modeling through selected examples from state-of-the-art studies carried out in different research fields. Furthermore, what current studies teach us and how future studies can benefit from agent-based models are briefly discussed.}

In the case of disease-caused mortality, the mortality attributed to one disease has the potential to buffer populations against subsequent alternative disease outbreaks by reducing populations and thus contacts needed to sustain disease transmission. However, substantial disease-driven population declines may also prevent populations from recovering, leading to localized extinctions. Hemorrhagic disease ({HD}), a vector-transmitted, viral disease in white-tailed deer ({WTD}), similar to chronic wasting disease ({CWD}), a prion disease, has increased in frequency and distribution in the United States. However, unlike {CWD}, which progresses slowly, {HD} can cause mortality only days after infection. Hemorrhagic disease outbreaks can result in substantial localized mortality events in {WTD} near vector habitats such as wetlands and may reduce local deer densities and consequent {CWD} transmission. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential for {HD} outbreaks to buffer {CWD} risk where the diseases co-occur. Using an agent-based modeling approach, we found that frequent, intense {HD} outbreaks have the potential to mitigate {CWD} risk, especially if those outbreaks occur shortly after {CWD} introduction. However, {HD} outbreaks that do not result in substantial {WTD} mortality are unlikely to impact {CWD} or {WTD} population dynamics. Severe {HD} outbreaks may reduce {CWD} cases and could present an opportunity for managers to boost {CWD} control initiatives in a post-{HD} outbreak year.}

abstract = {White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are a cervid species found mostly in the Americas. Managing white-tailed deer requires understanding their relationship with the environment, which was characterized by Roseberry and Woolf (Wildlife Society Bulletin 1, 1998, 252) for all counties in Illinois, {USA}, who incorporated habitat quantity and quality in a deer habitat suitability index. However, this index was based on satellite imagery from 1996 and did not explore the smaller spatial scales used by deer. Our study addressed these gaps by developing a deer land cover utility ({LCU}) score for each {TRS} (township, range, and section), township, and county in Illinois based on the methodology outlined in Roseberry and Woolf (Wildlife Society Bulletin 1, 1998, 252) but using data from the National Land Cover Database (2001-2021). These deer {LCU} scores were validated against minimum deer population data using Bayesian regression with additional covariates relevant to hunting and deer density. These models performed well with Bayesian R2 values of 0.501 ({TRS}), 0.5 (township), and 0.969 (county). The regression coefficients for the deer {LCU} scores were statistically significant (95\% credibility interval not containing 0) and positive at the {TRS}, township, and county levels, reflecting the expected relationship between minimum deer density and deer {LCU}. Predictions made by these regression models on new data were accurate, with the median absolute difference between the true and predicted values being 0.398 deer/km2 for {TRS}', 0.085 deer/km2 for townships, and 0.066 deer/km2 for counties. This deer {LCU} could be used in other studies about deer in Illinois or studies in which deer are a relevant factor such as investigations about deer disease or tick distribution. This modeling approach could also be adapted to different wild species, locations, and/or time periods for which land cover data is available. \copyright 2024 The Author(s).

abstract = {Integrated population models ({IPMs}) represent a formal statistical methodology for combining multiple data sets such as population counts, band recoveries, and fecundity estimates into a single unified analysis with dual objectives: better estimating population size, trajectory, and vital rates; and formally describing the ecological processes that generated these patterns. Although {IPMs} have been used in population ecology and fisheries management, their use in wildlife management has been limited. Data sets available for North American waterfowl are unprecedented in terms of time span (\textgreater60 years) and geographic coverage, and are especially well‐suited for development of {IPMs} that could improve the understanding of population ecology and help guide future harvest and habitat management decisions. In this overview, we illustrate 3 potential benefits of {IPMs}: integration of multiple data sources (i.e., population counts, mark‐recapture data, and fecundity estimates), increased precision of parameter estimates, and ability to estimate missing demographic parameters by reanalyzing results from a historical study of canvasbacks ( Aythya valisineria ). Drawing from our own published and unpublished work, we demonstrate how {IPMs} could be used to identify the critical vital rates that have had the greatest influence on population change in lesser scaup ( Aythya affinis ), evaluate potential mechanisms of harvest compensation for American black ducks ( Anas rubripes ), or prioritize the most appropriate places to conduct habitat management to benefit northern pintails ( Anas acuta ). Integrated population models provide a powerful platform for evaluating alternative hypotheses about population regulation and they have potential to advance the understanding of wildlife ecology and help managers make ecologically based decisions. \copyright 2017 The Wildlife Society.}

abstract = {The alarming decline in global biodiversity, driven by various factors, underscores the urgent need for large-scale wildlife monitoring. In response, scientists have turned to automated deep learning methods for data processing in wildlife monitoring. However, applying these advanced methods in real-world scenarios is challenging due to their complexity and the need for specialized knowledge, primarily because of technical challenges and interdisciplinary barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Pytorch-Wildlife, an open-source deep learning platform built on {PyTorch}. It is designed for creating, modifying, and sharing powerful {AI} models. This platform emphasizes usability and accessibility, making it accessible to individuals with limited or no technical background. It also offers a modular codebase to simplify feature expansion and further development. Pytorch-Wildlife offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface, accessible through local installation or Hugging Face, for animal detection and classification in images and videos. As two real-world applications, Pytorch-Wildlife has been utilized to train animal classification models for species recognition in the Amazon Rainforest and for invasive opossum recognition in the Galapagos Islands. The Opossum model achieves 98\% accuracy, and the Amazon model has 92\% recognition accuracy for 36 animals in 90\% of the data. As Pytorch-Wildlife evolves, we aim to integrate more conservation tasks, addressing various environmental challenges. Pytorch-Wildlife is available at https://github.com/microsoft/{CameraTraps}.}

In order to achieve useful results, researchers require methods that consolidate, store and query combinations of structured and unstructured data sets efficiently and effectively. As we move towards personalized medicine, the need to combine unstructured data, such as medical literature, with large amounts of highly structured and high-throughput data such as human variation or expression data from very large cohorts, is especially urgent. For our study, we investigated a likely biomedical query using the Hadoop framework. We ran queries using native {MapReduce} tools we developed as well as other open source and proprietary tools. Our results suggest that the available technologies within the Big Data domain can reduce the time and effort needed to utilize and apply distributed queries over large datasets in practical clinical applications in the life sciences domain. The methodologies and technologies discussed in this paper set the stage for a more detailed evaluation that investigates how various data structures and data models are best mapped to the proper computational framework.}

abstract = {Wildlife management in the United States of America ({US}) is primarily delegated to the individual states wherein state wildlife agencies manage wildlife populations to achieve multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are an important species in the Midwestern {US} whose populations are primarily managed through recreational hunting. Managers aim to adjust populations by altering the harvest of antlerless (usually female) animals by changing the number of harvest permits available, hunting season lengths, or applying incentive programs like earn-a-buck, where a hunter must harvest an antlerless deer before they may harvest an antlered deer. We estimated the effect on antlerless deer harvest from changes in these regulations and changes in the number of licensed hunters across eight states in the Midwest. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate individual state and regional (i.e., across all states) effects. We found that increasing antlerless harvest permits increased antlerless harvest; however, this effect plateaued as the number of available permits increased. Providing unlimited harvest permits increased harvest, but the same increases were achieved by minimally increasing the number of limited harvest permits. Increasing the length of hunting season had a generally positive effect on antlerless harvest but the effect was non-linear and state dependent. The earn-a-buck incentive program resulted in the largest estimated increase in harvest. Finally, the number of licensed deer hunters in a state had a strong positive effect on the number of antlerless deer harvested. Our findings show that commonly applied changes in harvest regulations have a weak effect on the number of antlerless deer harvested, highlighting the challenges facing deer managers in the Midwestern {US}.

abstract = {Sharing landscapes with wildlife is difficult because these landscapes have the potential to bring multiple costs for both people and wildlife. Finding solutions to promote human-wildlife coexistence is therefore critical, especially in the face of rapid global biodiversity loss. While traditionally the problem was addressed by implementing technological solutions to reduce negative wildlife impacts, more recently the complexity of the problem is recognized but tools and methods to deal with this complexity are scarce. In this perspective we apply causal loop diagrams and a leverage point perspective to synthesize the results of our long-term research in communal conservancies in the Zambezi region of Namibia and to better understand the complexity of this human-wildlife social-ecological system. After identifying 32 variables and 47 relationships between these variables, we constructed two causal loop diagrams consisting of two sub-systems \textemdash a \textquotedblleftgovernance\textquotedblright sub-system and a \textquotedblleftwildlife\textquotedblright sub-system. From the 32 variables, we identified four that could potentially leverage systemic change to improve human-wildlife coexistence. These were: 1. conflict between people, 2. tolerance by people for wildlife, 3. policy clarity, relevance, and congruence; and 4. congruence and relevance of governance structure with local conditions. Social learning programs involving training in nonviolent communication, global sustainability challenges and new governance models emerged as potentially valuable interventions. Our approach focusing on causal relationships and leverage points was useful to synthesize complex findings from long-term research and engage stakeholders in joint learning processes.}

abstract = {1. In shared environments, where different species interact depending on overlapping resources, complex interspecific interactions emerge, with human activities impacting these dynamics and influencing wildlife abundance and distribution. In the Alps, the presence of multiple species of ungulates, such as roe deer and red deer, and a predator, the wolf, creates a web of spatial and behavioural interactions in an area where farming, hunting and tourism have persisted over time, with tourism recently experiencing a substantial growth. 2. Accounting for these multiple interactions, we modelled the co-occurrence probabilities of roe deer, red deer and wolves in an area of the Maritime Alps using data derived from 60 camera traps. We applied multi-species occupancy models to investigate (i) the role of species co-occurrences in explaining the occupancy of model species across the landscape, (ii) the role of human presence and activities on species occupancy and (iii) the potential effect of the hunting season on the species detection probabilities. 3. Among the identified species, roe deer reported the highest frequency of recorded events and was the most widespread species. We provided important evidence of interspecific dependence, revealing that pairwise interactions among species had greater impact than only considering individual environmental effects. We documented that the setting of cameras on trails increased the likelihood of detecting wolves but decreased the likelihood of detecting ungulates. Most importantly, the hunting season significantly reduced the likelihood of capturing roe deer, while having no effect on either red deer or wolves. 4. Our results confirmed the relevance of including prey, predators and human dynamics as a whole. Since the sharing of habitat makes human activities significantly important in defining predator-prey mechanisms, our insights are particularly relevant for defining solutions to optimize human-wildlife coexistence, especially in a highly anthropogenic system such as Europe.}

However, predator populations are particularly difficult to quantify, and it remains unclear if and when eastern coyotes will reach carrying capacity. To assess coyote population trends, we constructed an integrated population model ({IPM}) using coyote data recorded at the United States Department of Energy's Savannah River Site ({SRS}), a 78,000‐ha National Environmental Research Park located in South Carolina, United States. Coyote densities averaged 50 coyotes/100 km 2 prior to lethal control in 2010 but dropped to 14 coyotes/100 km 2 in 2012 after three consecutive years of intensive lethal removal. By 2014, coyote densities stabilized around 44 coyotes/100 km 2 . These results suggest that coyote populations can decline under sustained intensive control efforts but may rapidly increase when control efforts are ceased. Our results highlight the power of {IPMs} to estimate population parameters across long time scales when data collection is both spatially and temporally heterogenous. Lethal control efforts for coyotes are prohibitively expensive at a large scale and are unlikely to be a viable long‐term management strategy. Managers should instead focus on setting game species hunting limits that account for coyote presence on the landscape.}

abstract = {White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the wild and on cervid farms have drawn the attention of state wildlife agencies and animal health agencies as Chronic Wasting Disease ({CWD}) has spread across North America. Deer farm regulations have been implemented to reduce direct contact between wild and farmed cervids; however, evidence suggests that indirect contact to infectious prions passed through the alimentary tracts of scavengers may be an important transmission pathway. The objective of this study was to characterize mammalian scavenger and wild deer activities associated with deer farms and link these activities with site-specific spatial covariates utilizing a network of camera traps, mounted to farm perimeter fences. We monitored each of 14 farms in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania for two weeks during the summer, with a subset of farms also monitored in the winter and fall. Across all sites and seasons, we captured 749 observations of wildlife. In total, nine species were captured, with wild white-tailed deer accounting for over three quarters of observations. Despite the large number of wild deer observed, we found that interactions between wild and farmed deer at the fence line were infrequent (six direct contacts observed). In contrast, mammalian scavengers were frequently observed inside and outside of the fence. Supplementary cameras placed on deer feeders revealed higher observation rates of scavengers than those placed along fence lines, highlighting the potential for transmission of {CWD} through indirect contact via scavenger excreta. To evaluate associations between the number of observations of focal species with land-cover characteristics, two mixed-effects regression models were fitted, one model for scavengers and one for wild deer. Contrary to our hypothesis, landscape context did not have a strong impact on wildlife visitation. This suggests that farm location is less important than management practices, highlighting the need for future research into how farming practices impact rates of wildlife visitation onto cervid farms.}

Yet, like too much of anything, there are risks with their overuse. Herein, we argue that despite their value, our increasing reliance on, and incorporation of, models into our data analysis, education of future wildlife profesionals, and development of management decisions has inherent risks. We believe that increased reliance on models has resulted in a detachment from the species and systems that we model, which threatens the quality of our science and, ultimately, decision‐making. The impact of models, both pros and cons, on the wildlife field should be an often‐discussed topic at wildlife conventions and within research agencies and academic institutions.}

abstract = {Accurate age estimation of white-tailed deer remains challenging for wildlife management, with existing computer vision methods limited to trail camera imagery and manual dental analysis requiring specialized expertise. This research presents the first computer vision approach to dental age assessment of white-tailed deer, eliminating the need for manual tooth replacement and wear evaluation. A dataset of 243 jawbone images is used to develop a multi-fold Con-volutional Neural Network ensemble, achieving 90.7\% ± 2.6\% accuracy through 5-fold cross-validation. Attention map analysis confirms the model locates and focuses exclusively on dental features rather than imaging artifacts, successfully identifying the same wear patterns and eruption sequences that wildlife biologists rely upon in manual assessments. This implementation substantially outperforms computer vision models based on trail camera imagery and meets the accuracy standards required for scientific research and population management. The automated approach developed in this study enables rapid, objective age determination from dental specimens, dramatically reducing analysis time while offering immediate practical value for wildlife agencies, research institutions, and hunting programs requiring precise age data from harvested deer.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of high-dimensional biological data has necessitated advanced data fusion techniques to integrate and interpret complex multi-omics and longitudinal datasets. Advanced Coupled Matrix and Tensor Factorization ({ACMTF}) has emerged as a powerful framework for uncovering common, local, and distinct sources of variation across datasets. However, {ACMTF} lacks the ability to model variation linked to a dependent variable, limiting its applicability to studies investigating biological phenotypes. N-way Partial Least Squares ({NPLS}) is a supervised method that identifies variation in relation to a dependent variable but lacks the ability to identify common, local and distinct sources of variation across multiple datasets. To bridge the gap between data exploration and prediction, we introduce {ACMTF}-Regression ({ACMTF}-R), an extension of {ACMTF} that incorporates a regression term, allowing for the simultaneous decomposition of multi-way data while explicitly capturing variation associated with an outcome variable. We present a detailed mathematical formulation of {ACMTF}-R, including its optimisation algorithm and implementation. Through extensive simulations, we systematically evaluate its ability to recover a small y - related component shared between multiple blocks, its robustness to noise, and the impact of the tuning parameter ( \pi ) which controls the balance between data exploration and outcome prediction. Our results demonstrate that {ACMTF}-R can robustly identify the y -related component, correctly identifying outcome-associated shared and distinct variation, distinguishing it from existing approaches such as N-way Partial Least Squares and {ACMTF}. To validate its applicability in a real-world setting, we apply {ACMTF}-R to a multi-omics dataset integrating human milk microbiome, human milk metabolome, and infant faecal microbiome data, investigating how maternal pre-pregnancy {BMI} affects microbial and metabolic signatures. {ACMTF}-R successfully identifies novel mother-infant relationships associated with maternal pre-pregnancy {BMI}, underscoring its utility in multi-omics research. Our findings establish {ACMTF}-R as a versatile tool for multi-way data fusion, offering new insights into complex biological systems by integrating common, local, and distinct variation in the context of a dependent variable.}

abstract = {White-tailed deer are widely distributed in North America and for at least 10,000 years have been important to human beings for food, clothing, and tools. Market hunting and habitat changes in the 1800s caused a precipitous decline in the number of white-tailed deer in North America. Hunters acted to restore deer populations. By promoting and helping to enforce hunting regulations, transplanting deer, and funding conservation and management programs, hunters were the primary reason deer populations grew during the 1900s from 500,000 to nearly 30 million. Today white-tailed deer are the most popular big game animal in North America and hunters continue to fund deer management and research. Hunters help wildlife agencies to manage white-tailed deer populations within ecological and cultural carrying capacity by harvesting deer. Thus, hunters, with their interest in viable deer populations, are integral to the conservation and management of white-tailed deer in North America.}

We surveyed deer biologists at state conservation agencies to compare opinions regarding urban and suburban deer management with those found in public surveys. We emailed a survey to deer biologists in 41 states to investigate what agencies are doing to control urban deer, which management techniques have been used in the past and are currently being used, and which techniques are believed to be most effective. Urban and suburban deer populations were increasing in most states (75.8\%); accordingly, most biologists (97\%) believed that urban and suburban deer were a problem in their state. Sixty‐five percent of biologists have not surveyed local communities for their opinions on deer and deer management. Managed archery hunts (85\% of states), sharpshooting (68\%), and managed firearm hunts (59\%) were the most utilized methods during the past 5 years. Biologists ranked managed firearm hunts (54\%) as the most preferred method for deer control, followed by managed archery hunt (39\%) and sharpshooting (39\%). Ninety‐one percent of biologists listed deer–vehicle accidents and damage to gardens as primary reasons for managing urban deer populations. Most biologists (88\%) indicated that urban and suburban deer management in their state was overall effective. Biologists and public constituents agree on the primary reasons to manage deer, yet their preferences for management options vary greatly. We recommend state agencies survey constituents regarding their beliefs and concerns about deer management beyond questions that simply address the acceptability of management techniques. \copyright 2011 The Wildlife Society.}

There are multiple transmission routes of the infection to humans such as consumption of contaminated food or water, handling of infected animals or bites from haematophagous arthropods (such as ticks, deer flies, or mosquitoes). In this study, we focus on transmission via the bites of ticks and developed a deterministic model of ordinary and impulsive differential equations to gain insight about the differential effect of prescribed fire on Dermacentor variabilis and Amblyomma americanum ticks and the prevalence of tularemina. We found that prescribed fire differentially reduce the number of the two ticks with A. americanum reduced the least compare to D. variabilis subsequently leading to differential increase of tularemia new infected cases in humans and rodents. Our result further indicates that the spatial arrangement of burn against unburn areas may not matter for humans and D. variabilis unlike A. americanum and the rodents which had more infected in unburn areas compare to burn areas when prescribed fire was implemented. The results of this study provide important new understandings of the intricate effect of prescribed fire on tick species, and the dynamics of the tick-borne disease.

In California, recorded mammal mortality was associated with human infrastructure, including proximity to roads, and to a lesser extent, the human footprint. Mortality of pumas (Puma concolor) was detected across nine countries, highlighting the need for international cooperation to conserve mobile species.

The three major threads within population and community ecology are theoretical ecology, statistical tests and models, and experimental ecology. We suggest that our major objective is to understand what factors determine the distribution and abundance of organisms within populations and communities, and we evaluate these threads against this major objective. Theoretical ecology is elegant and compelling and has laid the groundwork for achieving our overall objectives with useful simple models. Statistics and statistical models have contributed informative methods to analyze quantitatively our understanding of distribution and abundance for future research. Population ecology is difficult to carry out in the field, even though we may have all the statistical methods and models needed to achieve results. Community ecology is growing rapidly with much description but less understanding of why changes occur. Biodiversity science cuts across all these subdivisions but rarely digs into the necessary population and community science that might solve conservation problems. Climate change affects all aspects of ecology but to assume that everything in population and community ecology is driven by climate change is oversimplified. We make recommendations on how to advance the field with advice for present and future generations of population and community ecologists. \copyright 2024 The Author(s).

We tested whether different ecological predictors (e.g., pathogen prevalence, population diversity, inequality) explain the past and predict future trust levels across countries. We used societal growth curve models to disentangle between- from within-country effects and evaluated the accuracy of the models' out-of-sample predictions using the train-test split method: We used data from 1981-2009 to "train" the models and obtain predictions of trust for the period of 2010-2014. None of our models was more accurate in predicting future trust than a simpler baseline model. Moreover, we did not observe a universal decline in trust. Instead, temporal changes in trust were country-specific, highlighting the locality of cultural change. Most ecological predictors were correlated with between-country differences in trust. Only resource availability and moral opinion polarization were associated with within-country changes in trust: Countries that became less wealthy and more morally polarized over time also became less trustful. These results highlight important differences between explanatory and predictive models and suggest that ecological theories of trust might be of limited use when predicting future cultural shifts.

abstract = {Deer are the most abundant large herbivores in temperate and boreal forests across the Northern Hemisphere. They are ecosystem engineers known to alter understory vegetation and future tree species composition by selective browsing. Also, deer have strong impacts on faunistic groups, often mediated by vegetation. The ongoing loss of faunal biodiversity in forests worldwide can be exacerbated by high deer population densities. Adapted deer management for the purpose of forest biodiversity conservation requires a holistic understanding of deer-fauna relationships. In this systematic map, we examine the existing literature assessing the effects of deer on faunal communities in boreal and temperate forests. Our aim is to synthesize currently described trends and identify research gaps for our understanding of deer as biotic drivers of forest communities. We reviewed 64 studies on how the abundance, species richness, or diversity of faunal taxa responded to different levels of deer abundance or density in forest ecosystems across the Northern Hemisphere. In total, we found almost 400 individual reported effects of nine native deer species on forest-dwelling faunal communities. However, our systematic map reveals that comprehensive synthesis of the current literature remains a challenge. Published studies often do not report contextual data essential for comparison and meta-analysis, for example, deer density, forest management, and predation pressure. Moreover, the methodological approaches of the included studies often only account for potential linear effects of deer on fauna, likely oversimplifying the complexity of direct and indirect effects that deer can have on their ecosystem. We recommend that multi-level enclosure experiments be applied to assess the impact on faunal taxa. This approach combines robust causal inference with the potential straightforward comparison and replication between deer species, forest types, and system productivity, which will facilitate the utilization of the results in future research and management. \copyright 2024 The Author(s).

abstract = {White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations have recovered to about 30 million animals in the United States, but land cover has changed during the interval of recovery. To address the relationship between deer densities and current land cover at regional scales, I applied random forests and extreme gradient boosting classifiers to model low and high deer density classes, at two different thresholds (5.8 and 11.6 deer/km2), and land classes in three regions during approximately 2003. For low and high deer density classes divided at 5.8 deer/km2, deciduous broadleaf forest overall was the most influential and positive variable in the central east and central regions and crop and pasture were the most influential and negative variables in the southeast region. Deer density increased with area of deciduous and mixed forests, woody wetlands, and shrub in all regions. Deer density decreased with area of crop, developed open space, and developed low and medium residential density in all regions. For density classes divided at 11.6 deer/km2, deer density had the strongest relationship with woody wetlands in the central east region, mixed and deciduous forest in the southeast region, and woody wetlands and herbaceous vegetation in the central region. Deer density increased with deciduous and mixed forests, woody wetlands, and shrub in all regions. Conversely, deer density decreased with herbaceous vegetation, crop, and developed low residential densities in all regions. Therefore, at regional scales, deer overall occurred at greater densities in forests and woody wetlands and lower densities in agricultural and residential development, which did not appear to support more deer. Deer preference for forests does result in damage to forest products, but alternatively, some may consider that deer provide important socioeconomic and ecological services by reducing number of small trees, particularly in the absence of other disturbances that historically controlled tree biomass. \copyright Published 2021.

abstract = {Quantifying the relative influence of multiple mechanisms driving recent range expansion of non-native species is essential for predicting future changes and for informing adaptation and management plans to protect native species. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been expanding their range into the North American boreal forest over the last half of the 20th century. This has already altered predator-prey dynamics in Alberta, Canada, where the distribution likely reaches the northern extent of its continuous range. Although current white-tailed deer distribution is explained by both climate and human land use, the influence each factor had on the observed range expansion would depend on the spatial and temporal pattern of these changes. Our objective was to quantify the relative importance of land use and climate change as drivers of white-tailed deer range expansion and to predict decadal changes in white-tailed deer distribution in northern Alberta for the first half of the 21st century. An existing species distribution model was used to predict past decadal distributions of white-tailed deer which were validated using independent data. The effects of climate and land use change were isolated by comparing predictions under theoretical "no-change between decades" scenarios, for each factor, to predictions under observed climate and land use change. Climate changes led to more than 88\%, by area, of the increases in probability of white-tailed deer presence across all decades. The distribution is predicted to extend 100 km further north across the northeastern Alberta boreal forest as climate continues to change over the first half of the 21st century.}
