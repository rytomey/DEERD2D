# General Information

- Project name: * Provide a descriptive project title (note: this title should be distinct from publications or datasets) *
- Version: * Provide a version using semantic versioning, so that it is clear how earlier versions relate to the most current version of the code (e.g., v1.2.0) *
- Short description: * Provide a one sentence summary of the software's purpose or functionality. This should serve as a quick overview, distinct from the full project description below. (e.g., Python tool for visualizing climate model outputs) *

# Project Overview

- Full description: * Provide a detailed description of the software's purpose, including notable features *   
- Date of creation: * Provide the date of creation of the software or the latest version release (single date(YYYY-MM-DD), or a range (YYYY-MM-DD - YYYY-MM-DD)) *
- Project Organization: * Provide information on the following as applicable: source code, pre-compiled binaries, tests, configuration files, build scripts, dependencies, documentation, static resources *

- Required libraries, packages, modules: * Provide a list of required dependencies (e.g., libraries, packages, modules, etc.) *
        [!Tip] * A package management tool can generate a list of dependencies for a project (e.g., Python’s pip freeze will output a list of installed packages in a format that can be used to create a “requirements.txt” file) *
- Setup requirements: * Provide a description of any setup requirements (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) *
- Known issues: * Provide any known issues or caveats during installation. (e.g., compatibility issues or known bugs) *

        * Provide usage examples * 
        * Include screenshots where appropriate * 
        * Document how to run any built-in tests *
- Known limitations: * Note any known caveats or limitations  *

# License

-  Software License: * Provide a license (e.g., MIT) and LICENSE file and/or explain any restrictions on use *
        [!Note] * This should also be in the source code as well *
